      Burgers are flavorfull, creative and good size.  The appetizers are very eclectic as well.  Good beer selection as well, including lots of local beers on tap which is nice for a strip property.  One of the better gourmet burger joints in town.  Get me a longhorn burger and a Joes Lager.  Very tasty.

      The hamburger. Oh, you poor, misunderstood sandwich. So many people treat you like a fall-back. When people say, "Eh... you just want to grab a burger?" it causes tears in my eyes, and great gnashing of teeth. And I can only handle so much gnashing.  However, there is a place out there, a place that adores and cherishes you, you faithful friend, you. Holstein's, located in the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, is a gourmet burger joint that mixes classic with funky. That's pretty obvious when you sit in their leather-adorned lounge area complete with a pink-and-white cow. (By the way, we've named her "Holly Holstein." Run with it.)  The burgers did not disappoint. My friend had a "Hen House," a classic hamburger topped off with a fried egg. Never had egg on your burger? You'd be surprised. I had the Longhorn burger, a BBQ burger topped with brisket. Fantastic. No stale burgers here; each bite was succulent, as if a little miniature chef was on our table crafting every bite just at the time we ate it.  Holstein's has about 34 million beers on tap. OK, maybe not 34 million, but a lot. We didn't have any alcohol, as it was only noon and neither of us were in the mood to drink yet. (In Vegas? NO! Yes, you have to detox SOMETIME.) That would be my only complaint about the place, they really try hard to force the alcohol on you. We were asked about six different times if we wanted a drink or if we had looked over the bar menu. The first three times we said no should have been an indication; by the sixth time I wanted to say "Yeah, if you're comping it."  I've heard the shakes are killer; it's definitely on my to-do list next time I come. And there will be a next time. Oh Holstein's... shut up. Just shut up... you had me at "hamburger."  (By the way, when you go, find the painting of the robot in the lounge, and tell me he's not being a little obscene. Just saying.)  PS: Full disclosure here: I work at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, where Holstein's is located. However, as the hotel encourages honesty from its employees, I have been honest in this review. I am also not affiliated with the F&amp;B department.

      Just tried out this place as a buddy and I were checking out the new Cosmopolitan. Win!  Creative food and a great twist on the burger joint idea. My buddy had the regular burger and raved that is was the tastiest he's had and I had the lobster sandwich which was also quite tasty. Everything is presented well and taste is big!  Desserts are creative too. I grabbed the Coffee and Donuts which sounds awfully normal. However, it was presented on a platter as a chocolate infused coffee with marshmallows served with gourmet donut holes filled with different flavored pastry cremes (like cardamom and cinnamon). SUPER tasty.  Great joint, great MUSIC too. They must have a resident DJ who does some creative transitions between classic 80s.  Definitely going back!

      The Big Fat Greek Lamburger has an unfrotunately cutesy name, but an awesome flavor. Most of the fancy burgers run about 14 bucks and the classic burger is 11 bucks. Prices are not too unusual for a fancy strip burger joint. MY wife loved her burger too. We will be going back sometime in the future.

      After checking out the Cosmo hotel, we went on a hunt for something to eat. Most of the restaurants weren't opening until later that day (opening weekend of the hotel) so we didn't have many options.  We waited a while before being seated, despite the fact that there were numerous open tables and TONS of staff just STANDING AROUND.  It took about 15 minutes before anyone approached us. Staff was EXTREMELY disorganized, but I'll give that to them since the establishment had hardly been open for a few days.  Our food came and it was pretty good, despite the fact that the kitchen didn't get our orders right. My medium well burger was pretty charred and extremely overcooked (well done).  THEN, MY FRIEND PULLED OUT A HAIR FROM HER BURGER!!!!!  We told one of our waiters (won't even get into the confusion with this), who informed the manager and told us he would speak to us. The manager never approached us. At this point, we were extremely fed up. After the waiter spoke to him again, the manager came to our table, apologized and asked to replace the meal. We ordered our friend a chicken caesar salad salad and a shake since the poor thing hardly had a quarter of her burger.  Our waiter brought out the salad and shake to go along with our bill and informed us that the manager would not exclude the shake from our bill. Considering the above events, this was pretty ridiculous.   On top of it all, there was no chicken on the salad.  THE END.  Wish Jose Andres new restaurant upstairs was open as this was our first choice. At least we got a glimpse of the chef while we were checking that place out.

      I came the second day it was opened and was surprised how the hostesses and waitresses were prepared to handle their duties and not fumbling around on what to do.  My first experience was at the bar where there were plenty of beers on tap.  The Honey Brown beer was actually really good.  The bar tender was extremely nice and gave me samples of two different beers before I picked one.  Then we sat down at the restaurant.  We were greeted with truffle butter popcorn courtesy of the chef and boy were they delicious.  Then I ordered the Kobe burger with fried avocado and yam with a spicy mayo sauce ($16).  This was a mighty juicy burger, but it's not as good as Burger Bar at the Mandalay Bay.  My friend ordered the duck fat fries and these were delicious with the aroma of the duck fat soaked into the fries.  My steak fries were not comparable.  We were too full to check the dessert out, but maybe next time.  Overall, a wonderful experience for a new burger joint and will return again if I visit the Cosmopolitan, although I will try out the other restaurants there before returning.  This is in between a 3-4 stars, but closer to 4 stars.

      I went here for lunch on the opening week at Cosmopolitan.  It's on the same floor as some other restaurants but seems to get more business than the others; we had a 20 minute wait.  Once we were seated, we noticed that there were a lot of empty tables in the restaurant; I'm guessing that they're a little understaffed.  I had the Gold Standard cheeseburger, which comes with sirloin beef, bacon, sliced goat cheese, arugula, tomato confit, and a garlic aioli.  The burger was quite good.  The ingredients tasted fresh and the meat was cooked perfectly.  Unlike a lot of gourmet cheeseburgers I've had, the grill taste isn't overly aggressive here.  The bacon definitely made an impact and the arugula, while mostly dominated by the other ingredients, added a nice crunch to cut the grease.  I upgraded my fries order to the duck fat fries.  It was my first time trying duck fat fries, but I wasn't impressed.  I was hoping to taste some duck in there!  They were definitely crunchier than the standard fry, but the steak fries here are very tasty as well and I would recommend those instead.  I also had the Campfire Smores spiked milkshake, which was delicious.  Very creamy and chocolatey, but for a spiked milkshake it was perhaps too smooth.  In conclusion: This is one of the better gourmet cheeseburgers I've had in Las Vegas so far.  Stick with the steak fries unless you're curious about the duck fat or really like your fries crunchy.

      ...it's really not fair to review a restaurant in the first month or so but here is my take...  Service...well done, perhaps overly compensating for opening week...kudo's to the Holstein staff in the lounge- ever so pleasantly packaged- and to the cute Latina running the host station lose the attitude- this is not Alex's,  YOU SERVE BURGERS...still Four Stars...  Milkshake- Five Stars- Pulp Fiction good....  Sliders or as they call them Tiny Buns- The Holstein Beef which on menu says pickle, ketchup and mustard...that would be one pickle, one drop of mustard and one drop of ketchup and day old bread... OUCH...someone in the kitchen staff needs to sneak over to First Food and Bar at the Palazzo and learn something about sliders...I actually laughed when I opened it up to see what was between the buns....One star...  That said my friend loved everything that had foie gras -"street tacos" and "duck, duck, goose" (a burger)....Five stars  Roughly three stars...I am sure they will make some corrections on the food and I will definitely be back....

      Pros: Holsteins is a nice looking burger joint in a very nice hotel (Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas). The prices are reasonable, the service attentive, the drink menu extensive, and the servers attractive.   Cons: My burger was not quite what I had expected. I got the Korean Bulgogi burger that comes with a fried egg and kim chi. Sounds epic right? Turns out that the patty was drenched in some type of sweet teriyaki sauce, which I was not particularly fond of. Also, the prospect of Duck Fat Fries was presented to us. Sounds epic too right? Its more or less just a gimmick that resulted in overly hard fries with no extra flavor whatsoever. All in all, a decent filling meal with fresh ingredients and a nice atmosphere, but not THE best burger joint I have ever tried. I would go back to sample another burger because my friends did enjoy theirs (they got the "Gold Standard burger.)"

      Great burger and shakes place in the newly opened Cosmopolitan. The sliders I had were awesome....crispy pork belly with hoisin sauce and their flagship Holstein burger sliders. The perfect cure for a Vegas hangover.  Service (like everywhere at the Cosmopolitan) was super friendly and approachable. I hope they can keep it up!

      this is another place with potential. The menu sounds awesome if executed correctly. What drew me in was duck fat fries. I. LOVE. DUCK FAT!   However, the only thing that saves this place are the milkshakes. I got an oreo one and it was super creamy and delish.   So i ordered a bull's balls (fried risotto balls), holstein sliders, and duck duck goose burger with duck fat fries.   The risotto balls stuffed with veal was delicious but could have had creamier risotto on the inside. The lardo on top was amazing but lardo tastes good no matter what. Theres no skill involved to make pig fat taste good.  holstein sliders were okay sliders but i've had better.  My DUck duck goose burger was a huge disappointment. Its a beef patty stuffed with duck and foie gras sounds awesome right?! and i ordered it medium rare. IT WAS DRYY AS a mother! and the duck fat fries..........lets just say i rather have McDonalds. no duck fat flavor which makes me wonder do they even use duck fat?! FAILLLLLL  Also a note on the service. I waited my entire meal to get a glass of water. -___________-'

      Hit Holstein's for lunch today.  sat at the bar.  Since i had to go back to work - no drinkie - had some root beer called rat bastard ( $5 ) - ok   order kettle chips ( $6 )   Gold Standard Burger ( $17 - add $2 more for onion rings )   Cool looking place, in the mall area of the Cosmo - place was hopping today.  Guy next to me seated 3-4 minutes after me - he gets his malt and sliders before i get my chips and/or burger....in fact, i never get my chips - the bartender didn't  hear me .....okaaay.  The burger - asked for it medium - it was juicy but no hint of pink at all ...none ... since the burger was juicy i can live with it.  My guess a quarter pounder, but not sure - overall, i liked it - the goat cheddar complimented the meat, lil micro greens were a nice touch and  bacon was all good  but $17 .... not sure about the pricing.    Onion rings were also decent but nothing out of the ordinary.  Will i try again ?  yeaaah - i want to try some of the sausages they apparently make in house.  A pet peeve - they make mention of everything made in house yet what do they bring me when i get the plate of food - bottled catsup and mustard ( i believe heinz and french's ) - geez guys, can't you make it yourself ?  or at least put the stuff in a fancy container ?   At least they didn't pull a kgb and when i ask for mayo they throw me a few "to go" tear open mayo containers .  pics will be posted later today

      Popped into Holsteins on X-mas eve to grab some dinner after the Cosmopolitans, Wicked Spoon Buffet was way to crowded.   I checked in at the hostess stand and was offered a bar seat or table. I'm not huge on dinning at the bar so I asked for a table. I was given a pager and told would be about 5-10 minutes. No problem, I'll go check out their gift shop. 5 minutes later the pager went off and I was seated in a near empty restaurant. next to a romantic couple. Nice! They couldn't have sat me next to ummm well let's see? Nobody else.  Chaz was my server. The restaurant has a DJ spinning in the front and the music blasts through the restaurant. He was mixing christmas songs with popular songs. Very interesting. I was sitting low and back to the music. and Chaz was standing tall. I could not hear him. Chaz was adequate though. Brought me an ice water while I looked over the menu.  Chaz showed me the extensive beer list but I did not want a beer tonight. Good selection though. They have about a dozen adult milkshakes on the menu. I chose the grasshopper made with vanilla ice cream, mint and chocolate vodka. It was just ok. They give you the excess shake in the metal mixer. The food menu is extensive for a burger place. A few salads, some mini burgers, and some starters. The stars are the burgers, done with different ingredients and combinations.   I wanted to try so many of the appetizers. But dining solo I only chose one. The chicken and waffles. It was lame. One tiny little waffle. It was dry. And 3 chicken fingers. The chicken fingers were good. Hot and crispy. Some ranch dressing and some maple syrup on the side. I'll try something different next time for sure.  For my burger, I tried the Longhorn. It came out medium like the way I asked. Toppings on it were cole slaw, beef brisket, and BBQ sauce. Very tasty but messy. I ate it with a knife and fork. I Beef in the burger was lean and flavorful. The bun was getting stale. It comes with shoestring or steak fries and for $2 extra you can get duck fat fries. These were possibly the biggest let down. Mine were cold and dry. The flavor on them was ok but I was expecting them to be tastier and more seasoned. I think I will just go with the steak fries next time.  Holsteins is not In-N-Out burger. Expect to spend a few extra dollars here. A $10 shake and app and a $15(+$2) burger, It is not cheap. The quality of the food is very good and I can only see this place getting better over the next few weeks.

      A really interesting menu with some very creating choices.  Food was very good, especially the vege sliders and salads we ate.  Very friendly and a fun atmosphere.  I would eat here again.

      I would never spend the amount of money at a burger joint that I did the night I went, but my mom won some $$$ so we indulged a bit.  The hostesses were......not the most welcoming. I don't know why, but they were distracted and just not very nice. Not rude, just not nice.  We had multiple waiters but one in particular who was dressed differently than anyone else in all black was probably someone special like the manager or something. He was super nice and VERY helpful when it came to ordering our food. I wanted to leave him a bigger tip but we weren't sure who would get it so we just left a 15% tip. I would not have left that much though if it wasn't for him. Service was slow and needed repeating multiple times. By chance, one of my friends and his girlfriend were seated next to us. She asked for her food to go. She got it and then asked for her check. By the time she got her check (which she had to ask for again) she had finished the food she had gotten "to go".  The food was really good. I ordered the Duck Duck Goose because nice-waiter-guy said it was the most popular and very gourmet. Maybe so, but I didn't enjoy it that much. The taste was weird to me and it was kind of dry.  The Rising Sun on the other hand was completely excellent to me!!!! So much and many flavors. If you've read my other reviews, I'm all about many flavors!!! ----------get this!  Sweet potato fries were okay. I still haven't had really amazing SPF anywhere.  Strawberry shake was okay. Would not order it again.  I would come back here for the rising sun burger.   Also, I'm really tired of loud, "fun" restaurants. I hate having to yell to talk.

      This is the restaurant to go to if your looking for a casual place for sit-down dining with a great price in Vegas.  What made this place PERFECT was that I had my birthday dinner here for a group of 31.  The staff accommodated every single one of us...including 2 children.  For being 2 weeks old, I was VERY impressed that the staff never missed a beat. As far as food goes...I had the Lobster Roll and the Lobster Mac n' Cheese. The Lobster Roll was amazing...almost like I was in Boston.  The Lobster Mac n' Cheese was also very good, but the most impressive part about the dish was the tiny bite size Lobster BLT served to the side.  It has so much flavor you want more. I was able to try some of the shakes, but one that stood out was the Campfire S'more.  I just remember the tastiness of the shake...then the warm sensation of the alcohol going down my throat.  What I like better was the malt. Everyone in my group was too full for dessert, however, the staff brought out the Candy Shop item off the menu in celebration for my birthday.  The only way I can describe it is that it had an interesting array of flavors and textures. I've been going to Vegas for a long time and this is the only place on The Strip where you can get a GREAT sit-down meal for reasonable prices.

      This restaurant was located on the 2nd floor of the new Cosmopolitan.  It was my first time in the casino and although the place was packed, the bartender was courteous and let me know she would be right with me.  After I ordered a Corona (22oz!!) I found a chair and order the Rising Sun burger.  I love this place. Kobe beef, house glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado!!! I'm done...  Good food and big drinks, perfect for a quick stop in Las Vegas, they've re-made the burger joint another favorite destination for my vacations here.

      This is going to sound like a farce, but I daydream about my meal at Holsteins on a nearly daily basis - the burgers were THAT good.  I was a little, um, rough from 2 consecutive nights of partying, and the burgers here dazzled my taste buds and satiated my poor stomach.  We started with Radicchio Salad which was large enough for two to share as a starter and was perfectly tossed and loaded with fresh parmesan.  We split a Korean Bullgogi Burger and a Gold Standard Burger, and trying to pick the better of the two would be like trying to pick the more obnoxious twin between Mary-Kate and Ashley.  The Gold Standard was a glorious pastiche of meat and cheese, vegetable and fruit, starch and sauce.  And then the Bullgogi, with the glaze, the egg, the trite kim-chi whatever-it's-going-to-be to make the dish "Korean" (in this case, kim-chi slaw) worked equally well together to create a fabulous burger.  I would urge anyone to order either of these but all of the burgers looked appetizing on the menu.  My only regret (due to an impending drive back to LA) was not being able to try one of the alcoholic shakes.    Oh! And since they mistakenly brought out the salad with the burgers (I asked for it before the burgers, naturally), they offered us a complimentary whimsical dessert sampler (I think it's "The Candy Store" on the menu) that was great; save the mini-drumstick cones for last!

      I will start out by saying, this place has good food.  I ordered the Rising Sun Kobe burger. It was totally awesome and worth 16 bucks.  "Why the shitty 2 star review Kate?" You ask.  I will splain it to you...  So its about 4pm on a Monday. The place is not packed.  Its our last meal in Vegas before we drive back home. We walk up the the hostess, tell her party of 2.  She asked us if we wanted to be at the bar or in the restaurant.  I tell her restaurant.  She says the wait till be 20 minutes.  I then say, if the bar has regular tables, then we can swing that. She says yes, and then takes us to a coffee table.  I dont want to eat a burger at a goddamn coffee table. So we move to the bar. Hmmm. Ok...   Bartender/waitress-  Shes a case.  I ordered a diet coke. She says "really?"  yes bitch really. She then also proceeded to criticize my fiance's order. "Thats really small you know. are you sure thats what you want?"  She also complains about her co workers not getting her??? wtf . At some point she tells this couple next to us, that shes young but knows her drinks?? As if they give a shit.  The whole time shes just talking to us sarcastically and then at some point im quite positive that shes hitting on my dude.    I can appreciate that they want the staff to be cool/tattooed/young but these people lack any basic customer service skills.  I will assume they will get many complaints before they figure out how to staff this place properly.    If you can deal with these morons, then eat here.  The food is for sure really good.  maybe you will have better luck than we did.

      Holsteins is a great spot - it has a cool vibe, reasonable prices, and delicious food.  I think its a great fit within the Cosmopolitan Hotel, and definitely a spot we will be back to soon.    We popped in around 6pm to grab an appetizer and a drink.  The bar was pretty full, but we were led to a spot with 2 chairs.  Good looking staff and some good energy was my first impression.    Wow what a beer list, I think there were over 75 bottled beers, and another 20 on tap. I settled on a winter seasonal ale recommended by the bartender, it was smooth and balanced and nice to try something I hadn't had before. My fiancee ordered the blood orange cosmo, which she said was very tasty and I can attest went down smoothly because she ordered another one in no time.    We ordered the 'street tacos' as an appetizer.  I love duck, and this didn't disappoint.  The flavors of duck confit, foie gras, truffle, and cranberry relish had me smiling from ear to ear.  It was delicious and we ordered another one after just a few bites (I wasn't doing a very good job of sharing with my fiancee, it was just too good).    Its too bad we had to go meet up with friends for dinner at another Cosmo restaurant, otherwise we would have tried a bunch of other items.  We will definitely be back, hopefully with a larger group of people so we can order up a bunch of the burgers, which look awesome.    If you are looking for a fun spot to grab drinks, good food, and not break the bank, Holsteins is the place.  I would imagine it would be a great spot for a little hair of the dog after a long night out on the town, or as a good spot to grab some food after a night of clubbing.  We'll definitely be back soon.

      TERRIBLE SERVICE - but the food was good.    I know this place is new, but my experience was ridiculous.  Tons of staff members, very few customers and we still ended up waiting for nearly an hour for our food, had drink orders forgotten and had to ask 3 times for silverware from the same person.    Good food, but not sure it is worth the aggravation...

      Had a chance to eat here on New Years Day and am SO glad that I did. I came here with a friend and we were promptly seated at the bar as the place was packed. We each ordered an adult shake... I got the apple pie shake and she got the mint chocolate shake (grasshopper). Both were absolutely delicious and you can definitely taste the alcohol! I can't wait to go back and try all the other shakes on the menu as we had a tough time deciding on these two. We ordered 3 of the sliders (beef, pork belly, and veggie burger) as well as the lobster truffle mac n cheese. The food is AMAZING! The lobster mac n cheese comes with a bite size lobster BLT which was fantastic and they do not skimp on the lobster in the mac n cheese! The "Urth" (veggie) slider was my favorite but the other two were also delicious and perfectly cooked. Service was great, the staff was friendly and our food came out fast. The only bummer is that I live in LA and can't eat here as often as I would like. The new Cosmopolitan hotel is beautiful and I can't recommend visiting it and Holsteins the next time you're in Vegas! I will certainly be back!

      HOLSTEINS .... TAKE ME AWAY  The first thing I noticed was the feel and vibe of the restaurant. It has clean modern high-end lines with fresh contemporary "local?" graffiti artist art work. It immediately grabbed my interest. The staff is friendly down to earth and looked like they were having fun. ( who wouldn't wearing hot jeans and chucks to work everyday ) . I was entertaining friends so we immediately ordered the appetizers that were perfect for everyone ( the foodies at the table and the overworked and just plain hungry) We had the duck tacos .... AMAZING and the crab mac and cheese .... to die for ! For lunch our table was impressed with the array of offerings. We had everything from burgers, the homemade sausages and salads. Every dish tasted better then then the last. THEN .... the best part of every ones day... THE CANDY STORE. You must order it. I don't want to ruin the surprise but everyone in the restaurant knows it is at your table. It is a sweet head turner that takes your breath away LITTER LY.  Holsteins Shakes and Buns made my day ! and I recommend it highly to anyone.

      Where do I possibly start....  It's pretty unbelievable to me that anyone gave this place a decent review for anything but the shakes, which to be honest... were fantastic.  Quite possibly some of the best shakes I ever had.  So why just one star?  Well...  When I go somewhere that specializes in burgers, I'd expect the burger to be great, at least good...  I would have even settled for mediocre...  Instead, it was easily the worst burger I have ever had...  I'd take McDonald's over this (I hate McDonald's), and for the price I could have had McDonald's 10 times over.    So how bad was it?  Well...  Ever had a burger that was cooked on charcoal before all the butane finished burning off?  Well... this was worse.  This was kind of like directly eating that charcoal...  So maybe I just got unlucky with that ONE burger?  No such luck, because the waitress took it back, exchanged it for another, DIFFERENT burger, and it was almost as bad.  At this point, I am not sending it back again because I certainly don't want them to spit in it.  I really wanted to like this burger.  Hell, I wanted to LOVE it.  The descriptions and promised flavors were so enticing...  But all I could taste was burnt charcoal.  The waitress said that some people are extra sensitive to the charcoal flavor, but my friend had the same bad experience.  Besides... this is the first and only time I have ever experienced a burger like that.   If I ever go back to Cosmo, I might have a shake there, but never another burger.  What a waste.

      Just because it's a Saturday night in Lost Wages doesn't mean every restaurant needs to turn into a damn club. At least, not in my world. And yet, here I am trying to enjoy my delicious burger and some conversation with my dad and his fiancé the night before their wedding over the droning sound of a DJ spinning Coldplay. So unnecessary.  My burger was really good though. I had the Rising Sun at the recommendation of our ultra flaky waiter, and it was delicious. Tempura avocado? I have told at least 5 people about the hunk of tempura avocado on top of my burger.   I will hit Holsteins again for sure, on an afternoon. If I see a DJ I'm walking away.

      Great joint for a burger at lunch or a casual, easy dinner. So convenient when you are gambling away at the ultra -amazing Cosmopolitan Casino/Hotel!

      Holsteins rocks....their menu is packed with lots of good things....so many things its hard to choose so I guess i'll just have to keep going back till i've tried everything. Loved loved loved the pork buns and the duck tacos....not to mention the chicago hot dogs and of course the duck duck goose burger (seeing a pattern here? we love duck and pork!)  The fries with our burger were hot and crispy (more than I can say for Comme Ca). Desserts were also fabulous and fun so save a little room!

      Went here with my fiance on our yearly vegas trip. It was loud because of the football playoffs being shown in the bar.  The fiance ordered an oreo shake, which was yummy. We ordered the truffle lobster mac n cheese as an appetizer. It was pretty good, but not the best I'd ever had. The blend of cheeses was nice and creamy, with a little sharpness, and the truffles really added to the dish. The lobster in the mac n cheese, however, did not taste like it was very high quality.  The fiance ordered the duck duck goose burger, which neither of us were very impressed with. He ordered a side of smashed potatoes, which were awful and completely inedible. They were cold and tasted like old dirty potatoes with no seasoning and no effort put into them.  I ordered the gold standard burger, which was honestly the saving grace of this restaurant. It was the best burger I've had in my life, and despite all the other problems we had with the food here, I would definitely go back for that burger. I ordered a side of duck fat fries. Not impressed at all. I've had better fries from in 'n out burger. I was really disappointed because I had heard that duck fat fries are supposed to be really good. I'm sure they are, just not at Holstein's.  We may go back the next time we're in Vegas just for the gold standard burger, but with so many other amazing restuarants in Vegas, maybe not.
