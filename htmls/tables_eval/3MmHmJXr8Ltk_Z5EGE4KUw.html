      Carne = meat  Vino = wine  Carnevino = meatwine  And this restaurant serves meat and wine! How ingenious! Mario Batali, you've done it once again buddy! Not only are you the best chef in the world, you think of the most creative restaurant names in the history of restaurant names! Bravo, my friend, bravo!  I love how the walls were decorated in the room we were all dining in too...nice and blank! Perfect! The big bull statue in the room added a touch of refinement and was tres chic! My filet mignon was presented wonderfully on my plate! A piece of meat on a white plate...no garnish, no accompanying sides, no sauce, nothing! And guess what, the meat had no taste too. Woohoo! Simplicity had never been so simple! And oh my god, the vast wine list must've included every bottle of wine ever made! I'm so gonna splurge on that $4,000 bottle of wine during my next visit here! It's gonna be sooooo worth it!!  10 million stars for this restaurant!!  Brian T. = sarcasm at its best

      Great Place!  Who doesn't want to eat at a $$$$ restaurant while sitting right next to the casino?  ambiance sucks ass...a restaurant like this shouldn't have any bad tables.  Don't let them sit you next to the slot machines...the noise and the draft will ruin the mood.  Service was also subpar...dont blame anyone besides the waiter.    Furthermore, food was way too expensive and the portions were wa too small.  do not get the half portions unless you're looking to get a kiddie sized happymeal.

      I've always come to yelp to read helpful no-hold-barred reviews but this is the first time I've been moved to write one of my own because no one should waste their time and money at this "fine dining" restaurant.  Before we sat at our table we had a nice glass of prosecco at the bar with a very affable bartender - it looked like we were in for a great night...until we got seated with a server who was part used car salesman part annoying high school substitute teacher.  This guy proceeded to go through and lecture us on the menu for literally 10 minutes...we can read guy and we get it you want us to order the most expensive steak you offer.  This server (I use this term very loosely because we didn't get his name) proceeded to tell us that we shouldn't consider the filet or the fish dishes (really, Batali puts items on his menu that aren't good?) and that the sides aren't like Ruth Chris "you can't just order them" - what does that even mean?  So after mentioning that they keep many of the items in Italian to encourage "a dialogue" we knew that this was one strange place.   The night before my vegetarian friend suggested I get the buccatini without the pork and she recommended I get the small size, which is literally enough for one person but I should have been tipped off when they said they'll try and push the big size.  OK I'm a vegetarian and even though I'm going to a place called Meat &amp; Wine I'm allowed to be there and eat what I like.  So after asking for the buccatini sans pork he looked and me and said he wouldn't do it..."if we start taking things out of our dishes it'll just get strange and I don't want to put a plate of strange in front of you."  I'll be the judge of strange buddy and don't bs me because my friend ordered it last night.  HE WOULDN'T TAKE MY ORDER AND SAID "I'LL COME BACK TO YOU!"  What happened to the "dialogue" he promised earlier?  Needless to say he hassled everyone of my friends about our orders saying zingers like "that's just 5 bites and won't be enough" "you have to get all of your orders in now because it'll just get awkward if you want more food later."  After we ordered we all decided to leave because we were made to feel so uncomfortable - these servers must be working on commission.  I spoke to the matre'd on the way out who to his credit was very apologetic and flabbergasted the waiter wouldn't adhere to my vegetarian request.  He offered to seat us in another section - we just wanted to get out of this boiler room so he paid for our drinks.  If this restaurant wants to survive they need to chill out on the hard sell and let people order sizes and portions they feel comfortable with - even though I wasn't getting a steak for 2 I would have drank for two!

      MARIO!!!!!!  We went here because it had Mario's name on it and was recommended as a better option to (Emeril's) Delmonico's by the super foodie general manager at B&amp;B Ristorante - Lori.  She evangelized the incredible care and selection the meats choices when through to arrive at the table.  I also thought what does this 90lb wet little woman know about eating slabs of meat?!  But I did not want to eat at Del's again and this place was close.  And I have not put something of Mario's in my mouth that I did not think was a cut above.  We start at the bar.  It is a nice area in an average location just off the slot machines.  Sit at the bar and not at a table or you will have the oh so pleasant, "CHING, CHING, CHING, WHEEL of FORTUNE ringing you your head forever.  The bartender was very friendly and helpful - Steve.  We started with about 5 liters of Lurisia sparkling water - my all time favorite bottled water.  We wanted some tiny (alcoholic) bubbles so opted for the Processco.  Steve recommended we go for the magnum size as it was a better value - and BOY did it look cool.  We thought the wait might be an hour, so we went right into the apps.  Steak Tartare (or Cannibal Mount as it is called in Joy of Cooking - yikes!) was very well made; I would have like a piece of toast to host and scoop it up.  And the second thing we ordered....queue the angels music...AAHHHHHAAAAHHHHH...HOLY FFFFFFF! We had this absolutely insanely incredible lobster crudo (Italian sushi-style raw fish).  It was like sweet, soft, creamy butter with a light lobstery goodness.  It was one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth!  I will probably remember it the rest of my life.  And I am not a big lobster fan - usually overcooked and sauced and priced for me in comparison to what else I can get for the money.  Next we head to our table.  Service was great. We had about 5 people waiting on us at one time or another.  The atmosphere was a bit "old boys club" my hot little friend said.  There were a bunch of suits in there, but it was kind of what I was expecting from a Vegas meat house.  We started with three small servings of different pastas for the 5 of us.  They were all pretty good.  I still can not explain why I bother to ever buy anything with Dungeness crab in it in a restaurant. I am nutz.  I love the crab and usually just buy it up the street and cook them up and feast.  Restaurants ALWAYS try and make the crab something special by ADDING flavors - sauces, etc.  There is no need. It is already the best crab in the US!  I once again got a crab and black pasta dish and was disappointed.  DUH.  The other two - a SPAGO - with lamb ragu and burnt butter &amp; ricotta raviolis were a bit salty - they know it and are working on it.  To the meats of CARNEVINO!  The steaks were incredible!  My colleagues order a table side carved ribeye for two and the girls shared a fillet, so I had to order - dare I say - a 20oz veal chop! I was not paying for it and do not have any hangup about eating.  It was incredible!  Melt in my mouth sweet baby love!  Their steaks were perfectly cooked and incredible.  This place definitely knows its meat.  The two Soms that helped us were very knowledgeable and asked great questions to help aid &amp; lead my less wine knowledgeable friends around the list.  And there was the wine list - HOLY F.  I have not seen a more overpriced and unapproachable list!  Everything started at $150 and really was not interesting until $250 and went to average $500, up to $4200 LOL!  My recommendation - stick to the great by the glass and you can afford to enjoy the dinner.  Or order the mag of Processco and call it good.

      The bad reviews are piling up here for a reason.  Being a big fan of Batali's shows on Food Network, I was really excited about getting a chance to eat at Carnevino.  Unfortunately, this was the biggest culinary disappointment I've experienced in a long time.  First of all, I know it's Vegas but this place is horribly overpriced for what you get.  If I'm ordering $40+ pasta entrees, they better be some of the most rich, incredible pasta I've ever had.  (I had the black fettuccine with crab). Instead, it tasted like something I could whip up myself on a monday night using about $2 worth of ingredients.  Actually scratch that, it didn't taste like something I would whip up because I wouldn't have made it so bland.  Another member of our group nearly sent his pasta back because it was too salty, overwhelming any other flavor present.  Their 'family style' portions ($40+) were what I would expect a half portion to be ... the half portions ($17 - $24) were appetizer-sized and cannot be considered a meal.  I am a 170 pound male, not a large person.  If this is what Mario Batalli considers to be full size portions I seriously wonder how he can stay so overweight :)  We ordered several $9 sides with our meals and all of them were just ordinary.  Nothing stood out.  Very average.  No flavor.  There was only one entree that someone else ordered that looked impressive to me and that was the veal chop ... big, 2" thick and practically hanging off the plate with the bone in.  Unfortunately not many people in our party ordered meat dishes which is the general theme of the restaurant, so I guess the moral is if you do decide to go here stay away from the pasta and go with the meat.    The wine list as noted by others below is very extensive but offers few if any reasonably priced options.  All in all it was a two-course meal that took 3 hours.  TWO COURSES took 3 HOURS.  I don't know what was taking so long in the kitchen but we were dying by the end.  And still hungry after dropping $100+ per person.  I gave the review 2 stars instead of 1 because the waitstaff were very professional and I at least FELT like I was dining at a 5-star restaurant, even if the food didn't reflect that.  I left Carnevino craving some Macaroni Grill badly.  That should speak volumes.  If you want to drop some big bucks on a nice Italian meal in Vegas, look elsewhere.

      Awful, just awful.  The service was horrible from start to finish. A snotty kid, who could barely string together words to form a sentence.   Everything we ate was over seasoned. Very very salty. The pasta dishes that claims to be a half order is barely a children's order. Just about everything but the meat was bad. We had the porterhouse and the ribeye, they were carved at the table. Both were good not outrageously good, but ok. There were 5 of us, only 2 had wine and we spent 850 including tip and most of us were hungry when we walked out.   Everything would have sat better with us if the service was at all good. I asked about the sorbets, and the waiter said, "ewww, i personally hate sorbets, i'd eat the gellato." I said "gellato makes my stomach hurt, can you tell me which sorbet is the best." he said " sour apple sorbet tastes like sour apple, basil tastes like basil, chocolate tastes like chocolate." what a smartass, i dont need that when im paying 800 bucks for dinner.  I wont go back ever and i have already written a personal note to mario battali.

      I love the dining room here. It's grand, it's massive and it's a steakhouse on steroids. I know people have ranted about the decor, but I love it. I love the big chandeliers and the high ceilings.  The veal chop for $72 is no easy task to order. You take a little breath before you do but once you give over to the price, the beautiful piece of meat that comes out is fantastic. I ordered it med rare and got exactly that.   Yeah. It's just meat on a white plate. The better to see the red and pink and white fatty bits. Yum.  If you want sides, order 'em.  I don't need it. Just give me meat.  Meat and wine. Simple.  Even the menus are over-the-top. I loved reading the food on the front and then opening the menu to two giant pages of wine.  Service was attentive though my partner thought it lacked a rhythm. It felt like we waited a long time for our appetizers. But in the end we had to rush our meal because our youngest diner was ready to leave.  If you're on a budget, this ain't the place to go. You've got to come here and live large, eat large and pay the large bill.

      Yes, it's ridiculously over priced.  Now that that's out of the way the food is quite good.  The portions are on the small side, to be expected, but it was nice to walk out without being stuffed.  They brought us a spread for the bread that is probably 100% fat but it was so flavorful!  I had the squid ink pasta which was beautifully made and delicate.  The steak was a little disappointing.  For the price I expected it to taste much better than it did but it was just as good as normal steakhouse.  But the best part was the dessert!  These little Italian doughnut things...possibly the best dessert I've ever had :)  I'm a fan of Mario but next time I think I'm going to try his other restaurant...easier on the wallet!

      If you do not care for good service this is the place for you.  It is sad that a place with Mario's name attached could be so lacking in service.  It is clear that he does not spend any time in the restaurant.  I almost forgot but bread was NEVER brought to our table.  Maybe this is standard here???  We came for a birthday dinner &amp; decided to have cocktails instead of wine.  Our waiter managed to offer us a total of 2 drinks, one before the meal &amp; one during the middle of the main course.  Appetizers,  salads and first course, be damned!!!  You do not need no stinking cocktails...  Maybe there is not enough of a markup for them to try to get you to drink a lot of cocktails.  It seemed like $12 for a drink was a money making enterprise...  Who cares about service &amp; beverages we are here for the food anyway.  The food was amazing, bravo to Mario &amp; kitchen staff.  If only the rest of the restaurant was as good as this.  At least they have something to strive for.  If it was up to me they would all be looking for new work.  I am sure the existing staff could get a job @ chili's or applebee's.  Appetizer: Duck egg &amp; pastrami over a bed of asparagus.      Whatever disappointment i had in the staff was quickly forgotten as this was a tasty treat.  1st course: BUCATINI ALL'AMATRICIANA      Again this felt like Mario had prepared it himself.  This is why I am such a big fan of his.  I almost changed my order to order a larger portion of this as my main course.  I was even tempted to order it to go for a late night snack.  I was told that the pastas were all hand made.  It would not surprise me, this was perfect.  Easily the best past i ever had.  Main Entre: NY Strip with bone.  I added the GORGONZOLA MASCARPONE sauce.      This was aged to perfection &amp; my taste buds eruppted as a river of flavor engulfed them.  Desert: Flourless chocolate cake with a chocolate sauce on the inside.      This was the one disappointing part of the food.  Usually these are made to order &amp; are very hot as the chocolate oozes out of the cake when you cut it.  There was no oozing here as the cake was warm &amp; not hot enough for the chocolate to spill out of it.  It was still very good but clearly not made to order, or perhaps it was.  You never know with this waitstaff.

      Reading the reviews, I am honestly shocked.  I do agree that the food is quite pricey, but, in my case, was worth every savory bite.  I had a wonderfully secluded table not anywhere near the casino floor which had ambiance to spare.  I started with a delicious appetizer special of panelli, which is a southern Italian/Sicilian version of Falafal.  These were cooked to perfection, just like my Grandmother used to make.  Next was my main course.  This was a perfectly made fillet mignon.  It had a wonderful crust and was perfectly medium-rare pink middle.  And, for dessert,a delicious slice of cheesecake, made with ricotta cheese.  I could not find any flaws with this restaurant I would recommend it to anybody.

      Ok, I didn't eat here, but I did sit at the bar and have a few drinks and an appetizer.  The steak tartare was the best I've ever had.  the only complaint and the reason I knock it down a few stars is the price.  I ordered a bourbon neat.  The bartender suggest a two ounce shot of Pappy Van Winkles's reserve.  Now I like to consider myself a connoisseur of  bourbon but I'd never heard of PVW's so I said why not.  Freakin $55 per shot?  He couldn't have told me before I drank it?  Now admittedly it's not his fault.  I should have asked.  My drink and appetizer was almost as much as my dinner that night.  But I know I'll go back when I'm there next.

      Unlike some of the reviewers, I found the ambience of the restaurant enjoyable and relaxing.  I think that perhaps the disparity between reviewers loving or hating the ambience comes down to which side of the restaurant you are seated in.   The retaurant is split in two, bookends to an escalator to the skywalk to the Wynn resort.  There appears to be a pathway behind the escalators to go between the sides.   The people who sit in the main area where the bar and entrance are located in is nice and relaxing whereas the other side of the restaurant seems more likely to get the casino noise.  The music in the restaurant is a little too loud as well.  The service we had was excellent.  I'd give a 5 star if a review was based on service alone.    The food is where my star rating fell dramatically.   We started with fried calamari which was excellent.  Next course was two pastas - black fettucine (made with squid ink) with dungeness crab and a pasta with lamb ragu.  The black fettucine  was ok but a bit tastless although the pasta with lamb ragu was quite good.    For entrees, the osso bucco was good but the veal saltimbocca was ridulously salty and inedible.    It was the equivilent of opening a salt shaker and pouring it into your mouth.    Veal Saltimbocca is one of my favorites italian dishes and I couldn't wait to taste Mario Batali's version.   This was a huge disappointment.  The wine list, which I was looking forward to ordering from, had hundreds of wines.  It's an extensive list however the prices were too high.  We decided to forego the wine and go for cocktails instead.  Sorry Mario but I won't be back.

      Carnevino was quite an experience! Everything here was tasty, delicious, and interesting! I had the calamari app, blackened pasta, and a nice glass of vino! The ambiance is on point and it's worth checking out the next time your in Vegas and in the mood for Italian!

      It was worth every penny. The ambience was excellent (for the main side which we were on) Caprese was delcious, our tasting portion of the sausage orchiette was perfectly al dente, my osso bucco was very good and my girlfriends filet mignon was fantastic (even for medium-well). I think that since this is a Celebrity Chef restaurant inside of one of the top 3 hotels on the vegas strip, the prices could have been higher! Honestly! Yes it is all al a carte, but the sides are only $9 when they could be $12 like other steakhouses. The petite filet was about $10 less than it is at other steakhouses, i think its one of the best bargain celebrity upscale restaurants in vegas.

      Bryant celebrated his last remaining days as a bachelor by having his friends fly out to vegas to eat. We spent 3 wholes days there, just to eat one meal, because thats all you do for a bachelor party of course. The dinner started at 8pm, and didn't finish until a bit past midnight. Four hours is a long amount of time to eat one meal, but when you're served over 18 dishes, and grill 4 60 ounce steaks, it can take some time to prepare.  We were treated to basically our own room, and personal service from what seemed like their entire staff. I don't even remember what we received, but basically we got a tasting of over half the menu in one seating. In one meal i had my first taste of sweet breads, beef tartar, beef carpaccio, and lardo. Each were delicious in their own right. Sweet breads were described to me as the best chicken nugget i'll ever have, even tho they're not sweet, not bread, and actually made of cow.  After the appetizers 5 orders of pasta came to the table. The best out of all of them was the Ravioli Di Stracotto (duck livers), and i normally don't like liver, but this was damn good.   Finally the main course arrived, and we were in awe and in shock of the size of steak that we were ill-prepared to feast upon. They cut the steak table side, along with some of the best green beans ever. Some suffered more than other, but it was delicious, and i actually almost finished my share of the steak.  As the finisher we were served some Prickly Pear Sorbet, hand picked from the desert of Nevada, and 4 other desserts, and finally an entire bottle of what someone called a digestivo. To me it was basically just taking six ounce shots of hard liquor considering it was like 60 proof.  I was ready to die afterwards, but we had other things to do that night. Like, ... uh ... drink, ya ... drink.

      The service throughout our meal was excellent by a wiseguy right out of Sopranos, but the food was maybe a bit better than average and for the price that brings it down another star.  We were seated not in either of the main dining rooms, but in a back hallway that connects the two sides.    The tomato mozzarella salad was awesome and a friend and I split the rib-eye for two which was $165 for about 32oz of meat including bone.  I have had better steak almost that size at Alfred's in SF for $65 so it was hard to justify the value here.  The sides we ordered with the steak were just ok and we were pretty stuffed.  The bill for 3 people was almost $400 and we didn't even have dessert or drink much booze.  There are better places to eat in Vegas.

      I've been to Carnevino twice and have been very disappointed both times.  I'm a big fan of Mario Batali and had high expectations.  I've been to Osteria Mozza in LA and absolutely loved it. But my two dinners at Carnevino have been hugely disappointing.  Food-wise, the steaks at Carnevino are just okay.  Both times I've been there, I've ordered steak prepared the way the chef prefers - usually rare or medium rare.  Both times I've found the steak to be too tough, too chewy or too fatty.  The taste is good but I've had steaks at some of the best steakhouses in the world and this place is 3rd tier -- not second tier, 3rd tier.  Mortons and The Palm, even the Old Homestead are better.  Don't go here for steak.    And I hate to say it, but don't go here for the pasta either.  I've been disappointed both times with the pasta which is just ho-hum.  Compared to our nearly orgasmic experience at Osteria Mozza, this wasn't even in the same ballpark.  I hate to admit it but we had a much better meal at Rao's the night before (even though their meatballs are too dense).  We went to Carnevino to celebrate my bachelor party -- there were 10 of us -- and I can honestly say that the poor and insulting service ruined our dinner.  Thanks being huge a-holes Carnevino!  Let me explain.  The sommelier  (Kirk) was a complete and utter douchebag to my friends. One of my friends asked if they carried a certain wine and Kirk's response was, "Good God no."  It wasn't like we requested Night Train but this a-hole Kirk acted aghast, the needle skipped off the record, EF Hutton-style.  "Good God no... too buttery." That's a really pompous answer and made my friends feel like crap.  Thanks Kirk, you pretentious wine Nazi.  I hope your acrid douchebaggery gets you far in life.  A better answer would have been, "Sorry sir, we don't carry that wine."  You're lucky you didn't get your twitty glasses knocked off your face.  Secondly, the waiter (don't remember his name but he was a tall dude and also wore hipster 50s style glasses) suggested that we order a bunch of appetizers and pastas for the table.  We said sure, but I told him that some of the people don't eat shellfish so stay away from seafood.  What did we get?  Calamari (shellfish), crab salad (shellfish), and another seafood dish.  Moreover, we got 5 sets of 3 -- 15 appetizers for 10 people (with pasta and main dishes to come.)  It felt like the guy was trying to take advantage of us.  It was too much food.  Also, we received an extra dessert that nobody ordered.  We pointed it out to the waiter and instead of just leaving it (which is typically what is done in a fine restaurant, considering that we're running up a bill of over $2,000) he took the dessert away.  I mean, how much of a dick can you be?  We spend over $2,000 there and you're going to take a cruddy little dessert off the table?  I think that really says it all.  On the spectrum of "fine restaurants" this gets 1 star; on the spectrum of all restaurants, maybe 2.5-3 stars. None of us will ever eat there again and I'll do my best to spread the word about how crappy the service and food is at this place.  I will continue to patronize Mario Batali's restaurants because I can only presume he doesn't know how bad this place really is but if you have good taste and know what it is to get good service, you'll give the middle finger to Carnevino.

      I guess I had higher expectations eating at Batali's restaurant because Pizzeria Mozza and Osteria Mozza were both so good. Unfortunately, Carnevino wasn't as great.    We started with their chopped salad which was really good for the first few bites. The dressing got a little overwhelming after awhile. There were a lot of spicy peppers in there so if you don't like spicy then you don't wanna order this salad. Then we had the dry aged ribeye for two which was cooked the perfect medium rare we requested. Flavor was good topped with a little bit of salt and olive oil. We got the Yukon potato side which had a unique mashed potato feel to it. It was an interesting little dish but way too salty. We had a bottle of Malbec that paired nicely with our dinner. And for dessert we had the apple budino, an americano and green tea. Just FYI...skip dessert. The apple budino is nothing like the butterscotch budino at Pizzeria Mozza. Should've just gone with a port wine or something.   The service started off really good but towards the end I guess our server got swamped with new tables which wasn't a good thing for us. We waited quite some time to get our check. We had to hurry up and pay and get our gambling on. The hosts were very pleasant when we walked in and when we left the restaurant.   Ambiance was great and the decor was sophisticated. I would come back to try different dishes even though my first experience here was just mediocre. If this mediocrity happens again...I'm gonna stick with my Kona crusted steak at Capital Grille down the street.   Come on Batali~! Step it up~! You're better than this~!

      My BF and I shared the rib-eye and it was sooo delicious.  It was huge and was carved at table side.  The service was excellent and knowledgeable.  We also had the clams,  that was also delicious.  We were both soooo stuffed we didn't get dessert.  I will definitely come here again.  Next time I'll try Mario's pastas.  YUMMMMYYY!!

      freakin expensive... tiny entrees... somewhat tasty food. when you pay $50 for plate of pasta, one would expect a decent helping. i heard a lot of good things about mario batalli's restaraunts, but all three of his joints in las vegas were utter failures in my mind. i don't mind coughing up some coin, but the food MUST be amazing to offset any of the negatives. don't go here. save the extra $100/pop for the tables or lap dances

      On our last trip to Vegas my friend and I had seen Carnevino on our way to Table 10 and after a quick glimpse of the menu had made it a point to visit on our next trip.  On a recent long weekend we decided to hit up Carnevino on Saturday night. So much on the menu looked tempting but we both ended up opting for the 8 oz. Filet Mignon. To compliment our steaks we chose two sauces, myself choosing the Porcini Bernaise which was THE perfect accompaniment to my tender and scrumptious steak. The steak was juicy and cooked perfectly! The sauce was not a thick consistency, I would liken it to a thicker au jus. For our sides we chose the Tuscan fries- made with fingerling potatoes roasted with parmesan and herbs and parmesan/potato cakes (I can't remember their name!)- mashed potatoes mixed with parmesan cheese and deep fried into a small yummy cake. So good!  After dinner we were full! BUT my friend wanted to see if they had an Olive Oil gelato she had had in Batali's NY restaurant. To her dismay they didn't. However, we asked our server (rather our server's assistant) and he took the extra step and put our request into the chef. To our surprise the chef accomodated our request! A few minutes later our server brought out our Olive Oil gelato. What yummy goodness! Smooth and sweet vanilla gelato, light and fruity olive oil and crushed sea salt. An unusual combination but so delicious! A must try!   Our dinner overall was a great dining experience. The service was professional, friendly, attentive and courteous. The food was brought out timely, hot and delicious! The fact that one of our servers made a special request and was able to deliver just made the dinner that much more enjoyable and the reason I gave this review 5 stars!

      Horrendous! I can honestly say that NOTHING we ordered was tasty...rib eye was alright. But for the price, this place is a huge ripoff. $75 veal chop should be as tender as BUTTER...the veal was tough, and had a weird aftertaste. Pastas...all blah...salads...meh (think maria's italian kitchen) it was so bad that no one in our party of 10+ wanted to order dessert!  With the plethora of nice, expensive steakhouses, spend your money elsewhere in Vegas. SW steakhouse at the Wynn is very good!

      Probably one of the worst restaurants I've ever been to.    Our waiter (who looked like Mario Batali) was a dick, although the manager was extremely accommodating.    1. Prawn appetizer (average) 2. Black Fettucine w/ dungeness crab - i found pieces of the hard clear inner bone that crabs have (in my mouth) and it tasted extremely fishy which tells me it wasn't fresh.  3. Ravioli ($19 each piece), the size of a normal ravioli except with the taste of dog shit.. over salted, with some weird cinnamon brown covering and a random egg yoke.   i didn't try the steaks.. that might have made things better..   I was so mad after the meal that i felt like finding Mario's contact info to tell him about my experience.. but i guess yelp will have to do!

      I went here back in June but I haven't been able to post a review until now.  First of all, this place is a steakhouse.  If you have anything else, then well I can't vouch for the food.  My two other girlfriends and I split the porterhouse steak for 2.  The waiter was kind enough to allow us to do that considering it's a pricey dish.  We also split an order of salad, ravioli, and a bottle of Barbara d'Alba wine.  Dinner was fantastic.  Considering it came out to $100 per person, it was by far worth every penny.  The steak was tender and perfectly cooked.  The wine was delicious.  The wait staff attentive; this is Vegas after all.

      although carnevino is a steakhouse, they have a relatively good selection of non-steak items.  my friend and i have had dinner here two times.  if i had reviewed it after the first time, i would have rated it a 4.5...except a couple of the dishes were way oversalted (same problem with b&amp;b and pizzeria mozza)...all the other dishes were spot on flavor and seasoning...we finished off our dinner with a ricotta filled crepe topped with dry fruit compote and panna cotta with a huckleberry sauce...they were both very yummy...a perfect way to end our great dinner.  ok, so the 2nd time we have dinner there, we ask the waiter if they could go easy on the salt...the first 2 dishes to come out were the arugula with coach farms goat cheese and the razor clam special...both had great flavor, but again...was extremely salty...almost inedible...so we ask the server again...nicely...if the kitchen could be a bit more light handed on the salt...  basically...everything that came afterwards had no salt...so, it's either waaay to much salt or none at all...will have to reconsider before going to another batali restaurant  the best part of the meal was the coach farms goat cheese...incredibley good...the best goat cheese i've had...you can order online from their website

      In short:  The steak is great!...cant say much about the rest of the entrees.  My group of friends shared the ribeye for two and the new york steak.  Both tasted very well...the ribeye has more of a rich flavor, the new york has more of a meaty texture.  If you like the meaty flavor, go for the new york, I actually liked it more than the ribeye.  The ribeye was kind of dissapointing, for $135 I expected a bigger cut, but it did taste very well.  We shared the brussell sprouts and the chantarelles (mixed mushrooms and onions) sides.  The brussel sprouts were good, but the chantarelles wasnt that great (it was sauteed too heavily and clumped with too much onions, I didnt get a great flavor out of the dish,  just the sweetness of the onions).  The steak is broiled at 1200degrees, It came out almost black when they served it...the crust was definitely crispy, but it was charred to crisp...depends how you like your steak...I didnt mind the burnt crust, but some people dont like the flavor of the burntness and the unhealthy side effects of cancer cells.   We also ordered the seafood spaghetti, it was a little on the dry side, definitely needed more sauce...the seafood was good, the pasta had a nice chewy texture, it just needed a little more sauce.  It was almost like a dry spicy pasta.    For 50 bucks I would have ordered another steak instead of the seafood pasta.   The waiter was nice and helpful, he suggested a few wine pairings with the steak, which seemed to go well.   The server cut our ribeye tableside, which is always nice to watch.  The steak is cooked a little more raw than most places..but they serve the food on a sizzling plate so the steak cooks real fast.  Id definitely order it medium-rare, by the time you eat the steak it will be perfectly medium.   For dessert we shared the bomboloni, which is like a fried chocolate donut hole filled with rich oozing chocolate, served with a rum sauce. It was quite delicate and rich, very tasty and delicious!  I'd go back just for the dessert.  Overall experience at the restaurant was good, the staff was very friendly and helpful, the steak was great, the other entrees/dishes are just ok...But, this is a steakhouse, so order steak before you review!   Prices are really reasonable for a steakhouse in Vegas, expect to pay between $75-100 per person.

      The service people here are warm, attentive, and knowledgeable. Chris (GM), Melissa (sommelier), Nancy (hostess), and Mike (server) all deserve 5 stars each. Thank you for making my Vegas trip extension completely worth it.  Long story short, I'm a Batali fan because of Lupa (see my review). Walked by Carnevino took look at the menu and started chatting it up with Chris and Nancy. They convinced me to stay a bit longer in Vegas and take the first dinner seating.  "I don't want to see a menu; bring it on."  Courses: Amuse bouche - fried cheese balls. A bit salty, but who doesn't love fried cheese? (Carpene Maltovi Prosecco - I LOVE YOU) 1 - Lobster sashimi style with fried claw, fried lobster mousse, etc. The lobster was EXCELLENT. I've never had lobster prepared that way, and I'm a fan. (Bastianich Tocai Plus - I LOVE YOU - Best wine of the evening) 2 - Black (squid ink dyed) fettuccini - Fantastic preparation. Perfectly al dente and had balanced flavors. I could have eaten a huge bowl of it, but more courses were on their way. (Remoissenet Meursault) 3 - Fish - AHH!! I can't find it on their online menu so I can't give you all the details, HOWEVER it was very well prepared had a nice sear on the outside, soft and flaky inside. The sauce was a touch too sweet.  4 - Ribeye served tableside. Not a huge steak fan (I know... I'm at a steakhouse!) but I enjoyed it. Sides of riced potatoes (oversalted) and mushrooms came out as well. 5 - Dessert - first was a sorbetto and then fried chocolate balls. What's not to love?  The details are a bit fuzzy after the 3rd glass of wine made its way through my bloodstream, but overall the meal was delicious and fun.

      pricey but hey, it's vegas. the steaks were good but not anything you can't get at other similar joints. the pasta was excellent - would recommend that groups share some steak to get their beef, but chow down on communal pasta for the table.

      Simply one of the best dinners I have ever had.  First, don't skip the bar... not for the decor, but for the home made cheese straws that are baked each day.  They are friggin great.  The meal began with some shared appetizers; baby arugula salad, home made salumi plate with proscuitto made by Mario's father, and calamari.  All were delicious.  My boss and I split the bone-in ribeye for two which was carved tableside.  This steak was dry aged 6 weeks and cooked to perfection (slightly under medium rare, but not rare).  My only complaint was the lack of values on the wine list.  Seriously Mario, you place hundreds of Italian wines on the menu, and only a handful are under $100 a bottle?  These obscure libations are more respectable when guests can afford more than one bottle.  I ordered a L'Adventure from Paso Robles for $80 which drank well.
