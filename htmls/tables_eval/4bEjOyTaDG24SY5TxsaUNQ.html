      If you enjoy a little people watching with your dining, sit out on the outside terrace and watch Las Vegas tourist walk the strip as they celebrate their winnings or rave about the fabulous Bellagio fountains.  As the restaurant is directly across from the fountains, it is also a great place to dine while taking in the free show.   The food fits the setting, with a traditional French menu infused with a bit of Vegas penache.   We had excellent service..polite, prompt, helpful (great at helping us pick a great wine suited to our selections!) and personal.   And by the way,   the wait staff aren't above snapping that great snapshot of you and your guest having a good time....it is great to be a tourist!

      Though heartbroken and a bit aimless on my 22nd birthday, a meal at Mon Ami Gabi really helped cheer me up.  I imagine that if you go there relatively happy, you'd really enjoy yourself!

      The food and wine was amazing, but the super high price is going to make this a 4-star.  Although I must admit that the price was a direct result of ordering numerous glasses of wine rather than a bottle.  Dumb.  But it was the best meal we had in Vegas, so call it a 4.5

      Yippy!  Make-your-own bloody mary bar! Chose the vodka and go to town.  They have recipies to help you out if you need it.  We tried Mon Ami Gabi for Sunday brunch.  First off, I loved eating in the atrium (light, airy and classic), and probably prefered it to eating outside (who wants to feel like they're right on the strip amidst icky large groups and las vegas grime while spending a bit for brunch?).  Secondly, the service was OUTSTANDING.  The waitress even put in a special request for a specific  crepe filling not on the menu (the kitchen made it- smoked salmon, egg and jack cheese if you're curious).  Crepes were enormous and delicious (just too bad I couldn't lug a doggie bag around with me all day).  Not too expensive ($50 with tax and tip and champagne) .Yumyumyum. Will definatley go again.

      I went here for a team function on one of the evening's of my company's sales conference.  The place was a little crowded and dim but it was a festive and enjoyable experience.  The waiter was great and definitely made the experience better.  We shared 6 bottles of wine, 5 appetizers, and 3 salads.  I am not a big fan of pate, but you definitely have to try it here.  The Mon Ami Shrimp Gabi wasn't quite as good as advertised, but I loved the scallops.  One of the special's of the day was Beef Wellington, and basically I made up my mind right there.  Half of the group did the same.  The dish was in a nice wine reduction mushroom sauce and sauteed spinach.  The crust was flakey and the beef was melt-in-your-mouth tender.  The price was a bit steep, but hey it's Vegas.  I don't particularly like the Paris hotel and casion, but I'd definitely come to Mon Ami Gabi again.

      An affordable dining experience in Paris, I mean Vegas.  Location was built out perfectly to the French theme.  They had tasty appetizers with the country pate and the garlic simmered shrimp.  The burger was cooked well with a large amount of fries.  The bread that they serve before the meal can be, "cut the top of your mouth hard" so be careful.  A local recommended the french onion soup, but I totally forgot to get that.  Great views if you get the outdoor seating!

      Definitely one of my favorites on the Strip! I've been here several times and it has never disappointed! The food here is wonderful as well as the service.  Their steaks are fabulous, as well as their seafood.    Worth a visit if you've never been!

      What great friends I have..... We ate at Mon Ami Gabi translation (My friend Gabi) last Sat. night.  It was awesome!  It is located in the (wait for it..... Paris Hotel).  What more can a grl who loves Paris ask for?  Me and my 6 grl friends had a delicious array of cocktails, appetizers, and entrees that would make any American say Oh La La!  C'est Bon N'est Pas?  I had the Dijon crusted salmon and I couldn't stop eating once I got full. I had to beg the waiter to take my plate.  To top it off we got a round of creme brulee and chocolate mousse (Ma favorite!).  Sa delicieux!  The atmosphere on in the cafe and the outside terrace was spectacular.... Especially when you have a front seat row to the Bellagio light show.  Sa Magnifique!  Je serai retourner bientot!

      Mon Ami Gabi(Paris hotel) The restaurant is nice but you'll want to be either on the patio or at one of the window seats as that is the true charm here. They have taken full advantage of the fountains across the street at the Bellagio and this is a great viewing site.The food is excellent and price wise compares with other steakhouses in town. The steaks are served with FRITES which can best be described as flat french fries. Beware the bleu cheese new york steak as it is loaded with bleu which tended to drown the flavor of an excellent steak. The butter enhanced steaks seem to be a favorite and I enjoyed that as well. Nice romantic and worth a date night. Again it is to your advantage to be able to view the fountains otherwise this is just another restaurant. AuRevoir

      Overall, a great restaurant! Not too overpriced- of course price will depend on your hunger, pocket and taste. This is perhaps the only restaurant that allows you to sit outside &amp; view the beautiful Bellagio Musical Fountain show (every 15 minutes or so), while enjoying fine gourmet French-American cuisine.  I'd give it 5 stars, except for the following few reasons: 1. it is slightly on the noisy side (being on the busy 10-lane Las Vegas Blvd S) 2. It takes more than an hour to get seated outside, due to the popularity. 3. Some of the waiters are not very friendly or personable. Especially this one guy called Kareem: he is too moody for a waiter at a French restaurant. And unpredictable... He snapped at me in a very unkind way for simply telling him we're ready to order "why- are you in a hurry?" No, I am not in a hurry, but we waited over 80 minutes to sit here! "Well I have so many customers before you". I guess you must be overworked, Kareem- but it is none of my business. As far as I am concerned, you still need to treat me as a valued customer! I don't deserve to be given attitude in front of my lady. At a restaurant that costs $60 or more per person...  Other than that... highly recommended!  Our favorites here are: - Escargots Bernaise - Warm baguette bread - Delicious "Market Salad" with fresh tomatoes - Belgian Endive Salad (with blue cheese and pears). - Steak au Poivre (peppercorn wine sauce)- prepared medium - Red wine from Burgundy (around $7.50 per glass) sorry cannot recall the name :) - goes so well with the meat! - Creme Brulee - amazing - Tarte Tatin - apple &amp; cinnamon- but ummm, so yummy, so warm, so sensual. Not your average apple cobbler!

      Do they have to have frites with every entree? And the frites, pretty standard. Cheap by vegas standards for food .Decent view of Bellagio fountain show. You will be sorely disappointed if you expect this place to be a decent French bistro.

      This is a great place for brunch -- we ended up coming here 2 days in a row!  The belgian waffles with nutella are to die for, and the smoked salmon quiche is amazing.  They also have a great bloody mary bar and a bellini/mimosa cart.

      Slightly noisy but great food in Vegas at a very reasonable price.  The steaks were great and the appetizers were a bit heavy but it's French cuisine after all.  Sitting outside is great but hard to get on a weekend night.  Make a reservation on Opentable before you go to Vegas and you'll have no problem.  Wine list was fairly extensive but we stuck to drinks and the bartender certainly didn't skimp on the drinks.  One of the better finds in Vegas.

      i had a very rare medium rare fillet mignon here but the rareness was good because it gave the frites some nice flavor. good people watching i got to see a bunch of people eat it on the sidewalk out front those cooling sprinklers provide the perfect amount of moisture on the sidewalk below to make folks feet slide right out from under them good times

      I love how many of my favorite restaurants in Chicago have double lives in Vegas!  Had reservations at Mon Ami after our O show at the Bellagio.  Still had a short wait which was OK , took advantage of the open seats at the bar for our over priced french kiss martini.  We got really nice seats overlooking the Bellagio fountain and our server was so upbeat and friendly.  The food was excellent just like all of my other Mon Ami dining experiences.  Great way to start the night!

      amazing french restaurant in the paris hotel. lots of choices for steak and seafood, but delicious appetizers and salads too. very extensive, although pricy, wine list as well. but, you MUST try the french onion soup, it was my favorite thing on the menu the multiple times i've gone there. (ok fine, by multiple i mean twice. but i plan on going there more.) and apparently amazing seats for the bellagio water show. but it's too cold right now for that (december) so for now, sit inside until spring rolls around.

      2nd time eating here.  They actually had our reservation for 8 at 7:15, but we didn't get seated until 8pm.  GRRR.  Then again, it was CES week, and there were about 100,000 extra people than a regular week in vegas.  Great service, excellent food.  If you order anything else besides steak, then you have made a horrible mistake.  Most of the steaks were very juicy and tender.  Highly recommended, and definitely would suggest making a reservation well in advance.

      Vegas closes down early, and there aren't many decent places to eat on the later side.  And there are many things to steer away from at this restaurant.  The fries, for example.  They call these fries?  And yet, and yet . . . . There are some terrific wines, not horribly priced.  The steak au poivre is terrific, as good as any SF bistro (except for the frites which, frankly, suck).  The salads are executed poorly as to presentation, but the ingredients?  Actually pretty good.   For example, we had a serrano and mozzarella and fig salad.  Big old pile of the jambon, sliced too thickly, and there was no art in the presentation.  It looked like no one cared enough to make it pretty.  But the taste?  Quite good.  All very high end ingredients, and even the dressing was good.  Same with the heirloom tomato salad (flown in, who knew they cared) and the frisee with lardon.    So if you order carefully and not on the outer limits of cuisine (you know, plain and simple, don't get creative), you'll get a good, maybe even a great, late-night meal.  Sit outside and it's perfect.  Just like Paris (except it's the Bellagio fountains and hordes of Americans, so maybe not so much like Paris, except it's outdoor bistro dining, so that's like Paris, right?)

      I'm always a little leery about casino restaurants.  And I know, you're all saying..."But, Damon, Vegas is becoming a gourmet capitol."  Yes, I'm aware of this, but, that doesn't mean that there aren't stinkers out there.  Thankfully, Gabi is not one of them.  I've been to Gabi for a wedding party.  A simple friends get together.  And on Valentine's Day.  Every trip was completely worth the bill.  I'm not gonna give a run down of the menu, mostly because this is the kind of restaurant where you could close you're eyes and point, no matter where it lands you gonna have  a wonderful meal.  ( but make sure what it lands on isn't something you're allergic to, that would suck.)

      My experience at Mon Ami Gabi was amazing, and I will definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas. Actually I believe that is not the requirement that my girlfriend set next time we go back.  Seating &amp; Interiors - Inside is nice, but appears a little crowded and thus can get quite loud. Thankfully i sat outside..no wait at all for our table (we showed up at 6:30 pm and had a reservation through open table..15 minutes later, huge line outside the door).  The outside was very nice, with a great view of the Bellagio fountains (very romantic)...and even though it was slightly cold outside, they had a good amount of heaters outside to keep things regulated...was very nice outside.  Pricing - very, very fair. Considering most meals were $18-20..except for the $29 Filet Mignon Au Poivre I ordered...Starters were around $10 which is very good as well (hell, Chili's costs almost as much for appetizers)...I believe Desserts were around $8. The only thing slightly pricey were bottles of wine (cheapest bottles $28-35, everything else around $40-70).  Total price including (generous) tip for two people, two appetizers, one dessert, two entrees and a bottle of wine (remember i had the filet)..$128.   Service - SPECTACULAR. Our server Juan, was very articulate, friendly, on the ball with everything, and knowledgeable on all the foods.  Examples: it was slightly windy outside, my napkin fell, when i went to pick it up, he was there in an instant, picked it up, and told me he'd get me a clean one.  After eating our baguette, while crunching up he baguette paper, he was immediately at my side to pick up the trash, and offered another baguette.   Food - The filet Mignon was delicious, my girlfriend's lemon chicken was perhaps the best chicken I've ever had. At first I was a little scared of having only an 8 ounce steak for fear of being hungry..but i came out quite full..the banana crepe was also delicious. Presentation was nice...although the escargot could've been presented better, but tasted delicious..The Lobster Bisque..was truly to die for.  The baguette was good as well..the Frites weren't my favorite type of frites, but still quite good, filling, crunchy, but with enough potato inside to make it more than a chip.   Overall: The prices are very fair, I highly suggest sitting outside, the service is great ( at least my experience was tremendous). The food is awesome. I highly, highly recommend Mon Ami Gabi.

      Ate lunch here twice the past week when I was in vegas. French onion soup and open face shrimp salad sandwhich was good. Their salads are kind of bland and have flavors that just don't work all that well...or are not present (the guyere was bland).  A solid place to eat if you are at the Paris; but, nothing to crave or look forward to.

      really cool location at the paris las vegas hotel...right on the sidewalk so you can check out the array of people types who visit las vegas.  i suggest you avoid the patio seating when it gets warm out.  the tabletops heat up, and the umbrellas do not help.  at around 2:30pm on a wednesday afternoon, the hostess said there'd be a 30 minute wait.  it was probably more like 20, and my boyfriend thinks it's a scam to get their patrons to gamble while they wait.  haha.  they are so smart!  my boyfriend blew a dollar on the wheel-of-fortune machine, but gained $15 playing poker at the Poker Room bar.  the baguette and butter we were first served was DELICOUS.  quite possibly the most delicous bread and butter i've ever consumed.  i ordered the brie burger, but took it apart because i asked for medium well, and it was more like medium and i prefer my hamburger meat COOKED.  the bun looked delicious, but i wasn't in the mood to carboload.  the fries were pretty yummy.  my boyfriend had the chicken and brie sandwich and that was pretty phenomenal.  it made me feel bad that i ordered a burger.  it was just too bad we were sitting outside on the patio in 90+ degree heat.  i couldn't properly enjoy my food under those conditions.

      The outdoor seating is a must!  If you get there after 3:00pm you have a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains going off every 1/2 hour.  It really is a venu appropriate for all sorts of occasions-- from a romantic evening for two, to a little girl's 8th birthday party.  (I have seen all kinds of patronage)  Makes sense, I guess, since it is part of a hotel on the Las Vegas strip. Don't miss the French onion soup, for it is divine, and the roast chicken dish is amazing, too.  Be prepared to spend a pretty penny, though, as Mon Ami Gabi is by no means one of those cheapies scattering the strip.  It has always been a special experience for me.

      LUNCH - Mon Ami Gabi has pretty tasty food accompanied by a relaxing atmosphere. If you sit outside, you can spy on the streams of tourists passing by and watch (but not hear) the fountains of the Bellagio hotel across the street. Inside are darker rooms as well as a brightly lit atrium type room which lets in light but not so much the weather.   Onion soup - very deep flavor; not a very thick broth, but not light. There is plenty of delicious Gruyre cheese on top and some onions in the soup.   Lobster bisque w/ orzo - a waiter brings a bowl with a few tiny chunks of lobster and 1/5 cup of orzo rice. Then he pours the lobster bisque out of a little pitcher. The lobster bisque has a slight seafood-y taste but I found it bearable. The bisque is also a little spicy which I really liked!   Sauted Spinach &amp; Brie Crpe - a pretty large crepe with lots of brie and very fresh spinach. The crepe skin was a little dry and bland, but the brie and spinach made it better. The crepe also comes with a small side salad on the plate.   Classic Quiche Lorraine,  with bacon - the BEST quiche I've had anywhere. It's creamy and eggy and the crust is tender and buttery. The Quiche Lorraine also comes with sweet, caramelized onions scattered throughout the quiche and lends a nice contrast to the salty elements.   Vegetable Quiche - same delicious eggy center and tender crust and contains spinach and mushrooms rather than bacon and onions. Liked the textures, but thought it wasn't as flavorful as the Quiche Lorraine.   Chicken &amp; Brie Sandwich, caramelized onion and apple - this sandwich came on a soft ciabatta roll. The flavors were light but complemented each other well. The brie was mild and was delicious with the onions and the apples. The sweetness of the apples and onions paired well with the relatively tender chicken breast. Also came with a huge side order of Mon Ami's thin, crispy frites. I still personally prefer my steak fries, but fans of crispy fries should like the frites. Only problem was that some seemed to have been sitting around for a while.

      Yes, it's a LEY restaurant, of which there are a skatillion in my hometown of Chicago, yet Mon Ami Gabi is my favorite place to have lunch in Las Vegas.  If you get there early (like, right when they open) you're sure to score a table outside so you can watch a) the people and b) the Bellagio fountains.  In my opinion, that's really the best thing about eating here, although I also love the food and service.  Even though it's smack in the middle of the Strip, they've done their best to recreate a French bistro, right down to the waiters themselves, who are often from France!  Everything I've ever eaten here has been tasty.  Maybe I'm just fortunate, or maybe it's just that good!

      I've been to a lot of restaurants in LV.  At one point, the experiences can get all clouded (and no, it's not because I've had one too many).  But I really enjoyed Mon Ami Gabi.  Expect to pay a bit more than what you may have wanted to, but whatever.  It opened at 11, we got there at 11:20 and there was a 40-minute wait to sit outside!!  That sounds ridiculous, but my mom really wouldn't have it any other way, so we opted to wait.  Yes, they give you those shiny, shaky pagers so you can keep on gambling while you wait.  The decor was really pretty inside.  They have a Bloody Mary Bar!!!  Always a hit!  Of course by sitting outside, you've got prime views of the Bellagio fountains--so lunch and a show, always nice.  I ordered the cheese plate.  Everytime I go to the Paris Hotel, I  must have me a cheese plate.  They've got the good stuff.  My plate came with brie, gorgonzola, and goat cheese.  It was accompanied by apple slices, grapes, and candied dates---the pairings were really good.  It also comes with a couple different breads to choose from.  The coffee was really good, too.  Always a plus.  My mom and sister split a fish and chips.  The fish was high class.  This ain't pub food.  It was lightly battered and fried---it looked like the entire fillet of halbut on the plate.  The chips are a bit different.  They're more like homemade potato crunchies than chips or fries.  That was a bit of a disappointment.  Other than that, can't complain.
