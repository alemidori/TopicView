      You cannot beat the level of service you get at Vegas eateries.  Everyone is attitude free, prompt and knowledgeable.  I was especially impressed wtih the service at L'atelier.  My bf got the 10 course tasting menu and that was excellent.  You can't beat the mashed potatoes ... so addicitive! That came with the hanger steak, but I got he quail stuffed with foie gras and that was AMAZING. The foie gras ravioli in chicken broth  with basil ...  stil thinking about it.  And get the chocolate peanut butter dessert, won't disappoint.  Although the sushi bar idea was neat, didn't care for the red and black decor.  I had three courses, and shared the dessert from my bf's tasting menu, but I could have had just 2 courses and been full.

      Ok, so I'm here at this ultra-fabulous suite in the Venetian Hotel on a Thursday night. But instead of being out and going buck-wild hung-lo style all over town, I've decided to share my experience at L'Atelier with my fellow yelpers (woo for you!).  First off, I dig the decor.  Very dark and chic, trendy, cool I think best describes it.  However, I don't like the sushi themed tables where you are forced to sit at a bar.  Although it is comfortable, it's not very good for intimate conversations or playing footsie for that matter.  Second, the food was good, not great.  I'm sorry but if some of you think that's the best tasting menu you've ever had, then you've been to all the wrong restaurants.  The food is good, but the best dish has to be the cocotte of egg with parsley puree, mushroom foam and sauteed chantrelles.  The quail is also a hit, it's served with a soy/chicken demi sauce (or at least that's what I think it tastes like), truffled mashed potatoes, (Joel Robuchon is known for his potatoes, it's one of his signature dishes and is basically your basic pommes puree with an equal amount of french butter added to it.  It's awesome but sickeningly fatty.) and a micro green salad with truffle vinaigrette. Other good dishes include:  Poached kumamoto oysters poached in butter, lemon, chives and sea salt.  Strawberry milkshake with strawberry sherbet, fresh strawberries and pistachio crisps.  Not so good were the:  Assortment of ice creams and sherbets that the waiter failed to identify.  The grilled Santa Barbara Prawns with Romesco Sauce (just didn't feel like it was a real romesco, imho).  and  The scallop carpaccio with lemon marmalade (the marmalade was great), soy, evo, and pepper.  So you ask, 'Hung, if the food was good why only 3 stars?'.  Well if you'd just wait a minute, I'd tell you.  Service. Service. Service.  The bill came up to be about 300 dollars for the two of us, one cocktail and a water.  With that being said, service should have been to par with that of a true french restaurant.  The waiters should not have been snobby, unprofessional, unenthusiastic, cold or answered our questions with short remarks.  The conclusion, will I go back?  No.  But I am glad that I went here instead of my initial plans, which were to visit Joel Robuchon's Mansion next door where an average dinner for two runs about a grand.  I won't be revisiting L'Atelier because the cuisine is too Asian for me.  If I'm going to be laying out that kind of dough (which was equivalent to about 15 lap dances at Spearmint Rhino up the street), I should be eating food I know nothing about and enjoying the hell out of it.  And that includes not eating a quail entree served with a sauce my grandmother used to make back at home.  So those are my two cents on Joel Robuchon's L'Atelier, you can take it or you can leave.  AFK now, time to party!

      I ate here over a year and half ago and I still recall the experience.  I don't do too much retro-yelping because I'm afraid that the memories will have decayed, but not with L'Atelier.  The restaurant is modern-cozy, mostly red with dark low lights.  There are many small tables on the side and a large bar area with an open kitchen.  You can see the whole kitchen and the entire scope of preparation.  Sitting at the bar is an experience in it self, let alone eating there.  Unfortunately, I was alone for dinner, but then it made perfect sense to seat me at the bar.  It was the greatest experience watching the plates be finished, a meticulous process that took 5 minutes just to garnish the plates just so.  I just love watching excellence in action.  I had a small plate of smoked salmon on creme fraiche as a starter and then John Dorry with chorizo as a main dish.  It was served with a small pot of pureed potatoes that I will never forget.  They were so smooth, so creamy.  My server conspiratorially whispered to me were at least half butter and I could believe that.  Sitting by myself at the bar, I wasn't alone.  There was a journalist (from the same convention) on one side and a young female doctor on the other.  We made small conversation and were shared our amazement of the food.  I had three pots de creme for dessert that were wonderful.  Someday, when I can convince my wife to come to Las Vegas with me, we will eat here.  Watching the food preparation was great and the food was better.

      Our family was in Vegas and wanted to see what all the fuss was about, so we thought we'd check out Joel Robuchon's restaurant to see if he was really worth all the hype as "Chef of the Century."  While we'll probably have to check out the Mansion next time to see if he is truly superior in comparison to some of our favorite chefs like Thomas Keller or Julian Serrano, we walked out pretty impressed with L'Atelier.  The 11 course Discovery Menu took almost 4 hours to eat, so make sure you have a lot of time, but getting the opportunity to chat with the chefs in the open kitchen/counter top space was a lot of fun and made the time fly by (make sure you request a seat at the counter with your reservation).  The food compares in sophistication and presentation with Picasso, but in a more casual atmosphere (no jacket required).  If you go with the tasting menu, you're getting a lot of courses, so they tended to be more bite-size and probably a little more delicate.  Surprisingly, there is quite an extensive menu selection if you choose to go a la carte (I counted over 40 items you could mix and match, excluding cheeses and desserts!)  The most memorable dish for me was the scallop, served on its own shell, in a broth, that was probably THE most naturally sweet scallop I have ever tasted (even better than topnotch sushi restaurants, like Matsuhisa). There was also a superb cod in vegetable broth.  The chefs here really know how to concentrate A LOT of fresh flavor into seemingly simple-looking broths and marry them with subtle seasoning.  As expected with nouvelle french cuisine, there was a little pretentiousness with all the foams and micro-chives used (to our bemusement)- maybe a little excessive, but they never clashed with the flavor of the food.    I probably would have expected a little more from the wait staff for the prices that you're paying, but the overall experience was memorable because we got to chat with the chefs, who were superfriendly.  We definitely enjoyed ourselves and had a wonderful night.  I highly recommend L'Atelier, especially if you've gotten a little bored of the same old rotation of dishes at Picasso or Michael Mina (which are still excellent in their own right, but need to change up their menus more often).

      Joel Robuchon has been getting rave reviews. Some critics have called it the best restaurant in Las Vegas, one of the best in the U.S., and even one of the best French restaurants in the world outside of France.  The atmosphere was formal, but not stiflingly so. Service seemed effortless, because it was so well choreographed. I had a primary server, but there was a team of others to help.  I chose the sixteen course tasting menu. Each course was thankfully very small. Even so, 16 courses is a lot of food. Come hungry.  The meal: An amuse bouche. Not much to comment on.  Oscetra caviar and cauliflower cream. Many of Robuchon's dishes are much better than they sound. This caviar dish was one of the over achievers. As would be true for the remaining courses as well, the dish was beautifully presented. On the plate were a grape hyacinth bloom and an iridescent red petal of some sort. The food was presented in a small cup in the center of a plate. The cauliflower cream was creamy white. On the surface were a large number of tiny green dots, arranged in a circle. Now, cauliflower cream doesn't exactly sound like a taste treat. Wrong! It was delicious. Underneath was the caviar - also delicious. This turned out to be one of my favorite dishes.  Le Foie Gras. A small brick, consisting of layers of foie gras and Japanese barbecued eel. Both were top quality. A strange combination, but very good, maybe excellent.  Le Thon. A small cylinder of food; a beautiful array of bright colors - red, green, yellow. It consisted of raw tuna, micro chives, little splinters of ham, a disc of pimiento, and a quail egg sunny side up. The flavors were strong; for example, the ham was chewy and intensely flavored. Another winner.  Langoustine in a very thin ravioli cover, served warm. The langoustine was very sweet, almost the consistency of scrambled eggs.  As was true for every dish, presentation was beautiful. Excellent.  The simplest way I can describe this is as lettuce soup, with bits of ham. A plain dish, but very good.  Canneloni of scallops and zucchini. My brief notes said it was very good. As the meal wore on, I got lazier, and my notes got worse. Sorry!  One Brittany lobster claw, sitting in a small pool of dark green puree. The puree's flavor was as if a plant leaf had been liquefied. It was very strange, but I came to like it. Very good.  Kobe style beef bone marrow, filled with vegetables. I like bone marrow, and had high hopes for this dish. It was a little disappointing - not as rich nor as flavorful as I had hoped. Very good, but not excellent.  Abalone in ginger broth. The abalone was tender, not overly chewy. The broth was flavorful. Very good, but nothing memorable enough to make it excellent.  Fried sea bass with tiny leeks. Flavor and texture were both very good.  This was one of my favorite dishes: Japanese snapper, with scales, sauted so that the scales were crisp. All of this was placed in a rich lily bulb broth. Excellent!  A thin slice of veal. Good, but a rather normal preparation.  Oatmeal? That's right! This was a surprise, and a winner. It was cooked like a risotto. The individual oat grains were apparent, with some gold leaf applied. The broth/sauce had a strong meat flavor.  A smooth, creamy granite, almost semi-liquid. It had a strong peach flavor. Very good.  An oddball dish: caramel corn, consisting of excellent caramel but mediocre popcorn; fairly good strawberry mousse. It was pretty good, but I was disappointed. Why? Because, until recently, the menu had included a chocolate dessert which sounded great. As it turned out, I could have gotten the chocolate dessert upon request, as did a neighboring table.  Next, an off menu item: a selection of sorbets and ice creams. I chose coconut sorbet. It was intensely flavored and creamy, almost like ice cream. Excellent. Vanilla and coffee ice creams were also available.  Les Mignardises. This is typically defined as a tray of small sweets served at the end of a meal. In this case, it was a huge trolley. There truly were dozens of varieties from which to choose: chocolates, candies, cookies, nuts, and I forget what else. I exercised restraint and only chose five or six.     This was the finest meal I've ever had in Las Vegas. Each course was beautifully presented. Most courses were excellent; even the worst were very good. Service was very attentive, yet not overbearing or overly formal. The entire experience took about three and a half hours, but it never seemed to drag.  Am I glad I went? Definitely. I'll remember this meal for a long time. Would I go back? Probably not. The price is simply too staggeringly high - at least until I win the lottery.  The meal was $350, plus drinks and tip. Figure a minimum of $500 per person, or more if you indulge in a bottle or two of wine.

      Very formal atmosphere.  Kind of intimidating and I was nervous: maybe because I am about to shell out couple hundred bucks for few spoonfuls of food or maybe because I was being watched.  The staff was like secrete service: scanning your every move.  The second you put down your fork, they appear from the dark corners to clear your table for the next dish.    I had the 'cheaper' $200+ tasting menu as a testing run.  All the food turned out pretty, very French, and tasted good.  But I couldn't figure out why they are worth about $20 per spoonful.  Not as memorable as the $125 tasting menu at Nobu.  The best part that I remember was the breads cart and the desert cart.  You get to pick them off the cart - and there are many different kinds and all tasted great.  I wished they had a bigger plate for me to pile the deserts on (see photo).  So I have to conclude, unless you are multi-millionaires, if this is your money, it is probably not worth it.  However, if someone else is paying for it - GREAT!  Two older executive-looking guys in business suites sat next to me.  From their conversation it sounded like one of them is a customer.  Anyways, they ordered at least 3 bottles of wine - probably costing thousands each.   There's also a large family there: with couple of teenagers, totaled around 10 people.  I wonder how they can afford it?  But they seemed totally relaxed, like it is any other dinner.  It's an alternative universe that I can't comprehend. BTW, I left still feeling hungry.

      Las Vegas has snagged the biggest and brightest in everything, especially fine dining.  I write these reviews on the excellent restaurants I visited as I sit at McCarran (my flight's delayed), and I believe this stellar week started with L'Atelier for my birthday.  First the decor.  It's a small space with possibly 4 tables and an open space kitchen lined with counter seats.  The back bar is honestly a waste of space, but the tiny yet elegant surroundings give lend to a great friendly feel (I spent some time chatting with my dining neighbors on wine &amp; Vegas restaurants).  Sit for the counter service, and see your food being made.  Ooh la la.  Elegance in small portions that blow the taste buds away.  I've never have mashed potatoes (pommes puree) like this, nor have I had canard foie gras any better.  We went the small plates route, and along with those two mentioned, had the kusshi oysters, tuna belly with onion rings, and the beef and foie gras burgers with carmelized onions.  Each small plate seemed to flow perfectly with the other, and dessert continued in that fashion as the Le Framboise certainly provided that the surprise wasn't the only thing you'd remember about it.  Fine dining at its pinnacle, I have enjoyed the creations of Robuchon and plan to continue doing so.

      Joel Robuchon opened his First Official Fine Dining Restaurant  in the USA in the Las Vegas MGM Grand. He has opened his more casual restaurant L'ATELIER in New York at the Four Seasons and at the Las Vegas MGM Grand. I have always been very impressed with L'ATELIER in New York, Tokyo and Paris but never ate at his Fine Dining Restaurants. The taste, presentation, and creativity is exceptional and is a feast for your taste buds as well for your eyes. If you enjoy French you will not be disapointed in anyway. Do not plan on large portions as most the menu is designed as a multi-course tasting. I have had the eighteen course tasting menu twice and it is superb both times. Having ate at L'ATELIER many times I can tell you the food is very consistent in all the locations I have eaten at. The service was excellent also here in Las Vegas. The staff was professional and very nice. It is similar in price to MASA in New York so plan on spending over a thousand for two people including wine and gratuity. To experience the food to it's fullest plan on spending at least three hours. I highly recommend you go here for a special occasion and you and your guest will be highly impressed. Check out the photos on his website www.joel-robuchon.com.

      Alright, I had to try the "Chef of the Century's" restaurant. Fortunate for us, it was Restaurant Week and they had a pre-fixed menu for $50 a person. The dishes was spot-on delicious and service was impeccable. But I have to agree with the last yelper's review that you can get this type of food in SF. Perhaps if we ordered more dishes, I would be more enthusiastic with this review.  I'm not sold on this counter-style eating. It's suppose to be more modern and interactive.  If I'm going to spend a good amount of money, I don't want to talk my neighbors or accidentally bump into his elbows. I felt sorry for the waiters, they had to reach over the counters to give us the food. Not very ergonomic.

      A hard review to write as quality of food is relative to some extent but I believe that restaurants that charge this sort of price and aspire to the highest standards must be judged against those aspirations and expectations. Hence, although I did enjoy my meal very much, I can only give it 4 out of 5 stars. Mind you, I am judging it against the highest standards as I also dined at Bouley in New York, The Kitchen in Sacramento and Michael Mina and the Ritz Carlton in San Francisco on my recent vacation.  L'Atelier is next door to the Mansion, Joel Robuchon's 'main' restaurant where the prices cause even more watering of the eyes. The concept of the restaurant chain (there are Ateliers all around the world) is to dine at the bar to 'promote a more interactive experience'. There are tables available but you are definitely encouraged to dine at the bar. One advantage of this is to watch the chefs at work in the open kitchen. The odd thing is that I found the waiters not to be very keen to chat, hence nullifying the interactive experience. I was later able to engage the maitre d' in some conversation but mainly about soccer as I live in England. A lot of the time, the staff were gathered, chatting to themselves.  The decor was dark with lots of wood. Once seated, I was offered either still or sparkling water, no ice water as an option. $8 per bottle as I later discovered. I was driving and didn't drink. My request for freshly squeezed orange juice was met with a polite 'we don't do that'. This was the only top class restaurant I dined at this trip which didn't manage to rustle me up some juice. You have oranges, you have a juicer, you have arms, how hard can it be?  I opted for the $135 tasting menu. Was a bit disappointed to see that the foie gras on the internet menu had been replaced by egg though that did actually turn out to be one of the better dishes.  I suppose the main disappointment overall for me was the lack of innovation or have I been spoilt by dining at the Fat Duck in Bray (in the UK)? The other top class restaurants I dined at on this trip all produced moments during my meals that made me gasp in surprise. L'Atelier produced very well cooked food which was tasty but no 'wow' moments.  The best dishes were la caille (quail), some perfectly cooked tender pieces of meat in a lovely sweet-ish sauce (sorry I can't give you more details about it but the server didn't volunteer more clues as to its ingredients when I mentioned that I really liked the sauce) served with the famous truffle potatoes and the aforementioned eggs en cocotte. Though I had enough to eat, the portions were literally a taste in some cases - maximum of 3 mouthfuls! No amuse bouches to welcome you. Some of the dishes like the langoustine carpaccio could have done with another flavour like citrus to offset the sesame.  So, although I enjoyed the meal, l'Atelier didn't compare well for me with other places I dined in the same price bracket. Also they need to inject more interaction and life into the place if their concept is based around interaction.

      With a high recommendation from my brother, I decided to check out some fine French dining.    As those close to me know, I went on my annual trip to Vegas a couple of weeks ago.  And my good friends know that Esther does not gamble.  (Well, unless you count a max of $5 on nickel video poker).  So what else does a single girl with a disposable income do in Vegas?  Eat, Drink and Party!  First stop, as soon as we arrived in Vegas, we went straight to L'atelier at the MGM.  We order a bottle of wine, and start the Chef's Tasting Menu.  As soon as you walk in, the atmosphere is casual, almost farmer's market with the baskets of herbs set out in the kitchen and glass bowls filled with possible fresh veggies and fruits for decor.  Yet, you know that you have walked into an upper class sort of casual, as the color scheme is black and red.   It is counter seating, so you can watch the cooks prepare your food.  Since it is a tasting menu, there were about 9 or 10 dishes.  The dishes (glassware) itself was fabulous, I mean, very decorative and large.  The tastings were also fairly good portions.    We started out with a cucumber gelee with tarragon and cumin.  At first taste, I wasn't quite sure if this was a good thing, but with the second bite, I was hooked.  It was very cleansing and refreshing.  Secondly, came out the tuna tartar: using bluefin tuna with tomato infused olive oil.  It was awesome.  However, not the best tuna quality I've had.  I almost wish that it would have melted in my mouth.   One of my favorite tastings was the: La Chataigne which is a light chestnut velout with caramelized foie gras and bacon. God, so foamy light yet so much flavor.   The salmon came out with this little kettle of con fit potatoes which seemed like it had to have at least 2 sticks of butter and cream with just a little potato.  Had I not been on a "ahem" diet, I probably would have devoured the whole serving, but....I practice temperance.....hahaha  You can choose between stuffed quail with froie gras, but you know me, I'm a red meat sort of girl, so I got the hanger steak.  It was good, but you know, I actually think that the hanger steak at Mustards in Napa is much better.  The desserts.  OH MY GOD!!!! Mandarin con fit the the sheep milk yogurt...and the PEAR SORBET.  your meal cannot end on any better note.    EVERYONE NEEDS TO TRY IT!  Yes....It was a good meal.  No, strike that.  It was a great meal!!!!!

      Truly an outstanding place to eat a meal and so much fun too boot. Foodie heaven is what comes to mind when I think back on this dining experience. The counter service is the way to go so you can maximize your interaction with your waiter and the chefs working behind the counter. The small plates are perfect and I went with 4 of them. Each of the dishes was refined and outstanding. The portions are a perfect size.  Desert was perfect as well with the tart tray really blowing me away. Service was very good. The waiter was extremely professional and enhanced the experience. I loved the dark decor. The bill was pretty hefty but you only live once.  If you love food and part with $150+ for dinner then you must go here.

      No words can adequately describe L'Atellier de Joel Robuchon -- yet that is what one must attempt to do, so . . .  Nestled within the MGM Grand Hotel, we arrived on time for our reservation and were seated within moments to our seats in the center of the bar -- perfect for watching all of the "action" in the kitchen.  The decor is stylish, simultaneously elegant, enticing, and exciting.  The staff very attentive without being smothering.  And the food . . . the food . . . The tasting menu was simply outstanding -- and this was the best meal I've had since we were in Paris . . . truly spectacular in every detail.  I cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough.  It's that simple.

      Damn you Yelp for not allowing half-star ratings!  L'Atelier is a 4.5 in my book - great, but just not inventive and consistent enough to nudge itself into the topmost tier of fine dining.  Allow me to set the mood - this was the centerpiece dinner for my good friend and myself amidst a typically hedonistic Vegas weekend and we were definitely not disappointed.  We both ordered the tasting menu:  The Good: Cucumber gelee - very interesting execution and flavor combo but more shock value than substance Foie gras - yes, unfortunately, it was not outstanding, just good Veal - a touch too much salt but cooked well and the accompaniments were perfect in enhancing the flavor of an inherently bland cut. Quail - very solid but again, just not that memorable Crab and avocado salad -  a bit bland and under-dressed but otherwise quite palatable. Strawberry milkshake - incredibly tasty, teetering on the line between good and great.  The Bad: Halibut - steamed with butter and seasonal vegetables on top.  Precariously underseasoned and a bit overcooked.  Not really bad, just way below the quality of all other dishes.  The mind-altering Gazpacho - an amazingly bright and concentrated distillation of tomato with just the right amount of acid, fat, and texture in the background.  Great. Sweetbreads - perfectly prepped and sourced, and just amazingly executed throughout. Mashed potato - Robuchon's signature dish.  More cream and butter than potato.  Enough said. Oysters - poached (dipped for a split second is more accurate) in butter and served with sea salt and lemon.  Pristine in every sense and easily the best dish of the night.  Hell, one of the best dishes I've ever had.  Sublime.  I know a lot of people rag on the bar-style dining experience but we both enjoyed talking to the knowledgeable and friendly wait staff and seeing food get made right in front of our eyes.  The whole place was stylishly executed but low-key enough to not appear garish like many other Vegas establishments.  Unfortunately, the wine list was steeply marked up and overly Francocentric but there were myriad great choices.  Was it worth the money?  Absolutely.  Would I go back?  Yes, but probably not for the tasting menu.

      I was looking forward to this restaurant.  I at L'Atelier in Paris and it was stellar though with a casual atmosphere.  We were quite hip with the small plate idea and certainly didn't expect L'Atelier to be a tapas joint.  This L'Atelier lost a bit in the translation.  The food was good, but aside from the amuse bouche, nothing achieved the wow-factor.  The amuse bouche, which was served in a small clear jigger consisted of a foie gras flan, a very thin layer of a port reduction and Parmesan foam.  It was utterly delicious.  The cocktails were good, and a martini was $15 after the $2 up charge for a martini.  (Why a restaurant of this caliber cannot set a price for a drink is beyond me.)  The food prices at L'Atelier were higher than in Paris.  The small plates range from $20-45 an the entrees are $48-75 (e.g., an apparent 4 oz serving of halibut was $58 atop some vegetables).  We decided to repeat wonderful small plate experience from Paris and went with just small plates.  The server recommended 3-4 per person.  Things did not get dramatically better at this point, unfortunately.  The millefeuille salad was nice an consisted of two slices of wonderful mozzarella, two slices of zucchini, and two slices of eggplant in a basil oil.  For $20 it was good.  The foie gras, at $36 was about 2 oz of foie gras served with wonderful grilled bread.  The foie gras was nice, but did not compare to the Paris L'Atelier in quality or size.  Next we had a crevette and vegetable salad which comprised small poached bay shrimp (9 to be precise) served in a molded ensemble of finely minced vegetables, such as bell pepper, etc.  It was $28, tasty and refreshing, but at $3/bay shrimp I began to wonder.  We ordered the lamb chops, for $30.  I do not know where Jol finds his pygmy lambs, but it must be a precious source.  These lamb chops were attractive and had a piece of meat attached the diameter of a quarter and the thickness of four quarters.  There were precisely three of them. At this point it really dawned on me that they have no shame.  (Though the lamb came with a small pot of the signature mashed potatoes, which matched the Parisian version and taste of amazing butter.)  We also got the calamari and chorizo.  For $38, we got 1/2 cup of calamari and 2 tsp of diced chorizo.  It was very good, but c'mon.  Squid is about $3/lb.    We wound up with a chartreuse souffle with pistachio ice cream.  It was truly special and a bargain at $12.  The souffle was a normal single serving size and was flawless.  The wine service here is absurd.  All wines by the glass were $15-20 and the pours were obscenely scant.  The bottle markup was approximately 4-4.5 times retail.  Again obscene.  For two people, with these very light servings, four glasses of wine, and two cocktails the total was $300 not including tip.    I think this concept needs adjustment.  I was glad that we did not order the oysters.  For $28 one receives precisely three oysters, whose shells are the size of a 50-cent piece.  I don't care what sort of mignonette they make, no oyster from Seattle is worth $9.33 apiece in a restaurant.

      I came here expecting a very trendy mediocre food as this was Robuchon's cheaper version of his dishes, yet I was quite shocked what a remarkably selection of authentic delicacies they had.  It sucks that the slot machines sit right outside but you can't really say you don't see slot machines everywhere there, this is the city that has slot machines in the airport and grocery stores too, come on now.   Yes it's dark inside. Yes it's somewhat casual and somewhat trendy. But have you noticed how impeccably clean the kitchen is? A single drop is what it takes for one of the chefs to come running to wipe the marble slabbed down kitchen clean.   They also have pig feet pate` and "prosciutto" jambon. They also have the best mini-sized baguettes! If that doesn't impress you then I don't know what will. Caviar and escargot are so 90's (kinda kidding, heh heh)

      L'Atelier - does that mean "the best butter". Call me ghetto if you want, but one of the best things we had here was the french  Echir  butter. I could put this butter on anything and it would shine with pride.   We went with one Prix Fix and many carte items to accompany. This wound up working really well for us and I'd recommend the strategy to others.   Essentially every ting was great - langoustine fritter, tuna belly, gelee, suckling pig (oui oui), mashed potatoes (they are known for them and BTW they are like 35% "butter") and more. The beef rib eye was good, but the Poached baby Kussi oysters with French butter we the highlight for me - two orders please.  A more entertaining way to have a phenomenal meal...

      THE BEST MEAL OF MY LIFE.   10 courses of pure bliss.  You even get to watch the entire process unfold right before your very eyes.  L'Atelier is a mesmerizing and stylish venue.  The creativity in every aspect of plating, and preparation is truly amazing.  This is the type of food some people can only dream of ever one day enjoying....I feel lucky to have been able to experience it first hand.   All I can say is GO. And bring half of your rent check...possibly the whole thing.

      3.5 stars. i brought the rating down more for the service rather than the food. went for restaurant week last year because it was only $50 for 4 courses. i knew i would never get an opportunity like to eat at a place like this. after being seated i enjoyed the view of watching the cooks and chefs prepare my meal. started off with the signature robuchon vegetable napoleon. layered with eggplant, tomatoes, zucchini, and buffalo mozzarella. simple but perfectly executed. the next dish was the ribeye. a thin slice of steak cooked simply with some salt and pepper. it was good. the cheese platter was nothing special. then we waited for literally 1.5 hours for the dessert to come out. what the hell. they tried to ease our wait by giving us some small sampler tarts to kill the time. but no. it didnt work. the pisatchio souffles finally came out but our meal was already ruined. i was ready to leave and go gamble away all my money at the casino.    hmmm....maybe they know what they're doing then.       ps. the robuchon potatoes were freakin buttery as hell. (check my ubuntu review for part 2 of "robuchon potatoes")

      Walking through the glam and glitz of the MGM hotel and casino in Vegas to get to L'Atelier is like hiking through the world's largest Chinese brothel: wacky gold everywhere, carpets that don't seem to match the rest of the place, and NOISE!   But I don't want to be on a total playa' hatin' review of the MGM - L'Atelier is like the proverbial oasis in the desert of MGM's glamcrapatism. Red and black interior, soothing quietness, chefs hard at work behind the sushi-style counter that envelopes the kitchen.  This place is worth a visit - but I can't say it is in the top 20 of the 'best meals of my life.' I was able to wangle a prix fixe dinner at L'Atelier Joel Robuchon along with a show (Crazy Horse - Parisian strip tease!!) for $98 through the MGM's website. I added on some dishes not on the prix fixe menu. Along with drinks, my meal was a bit over $300 (one person).   I started off with a superb Bellini (a bit of a shock at $29). My meal included a starter of a composed 'tower' of Meditteranean vegetables (good), followed by a 'toast' of minced tomatoes and tuna (very good) and a tiny tempura of langoustine (2 bites but good). My entree was the onglet steak with leeks - very tasty in a reduction of port, I believe. The onglet was very tender. A cheese plate followed (delicious). I had a sorbet (cannot remember the flavor) as a final dish. Service was very, very good at the counter. My waiter refilled my water glass promptly and suggested a variety of wines by the glass to complement my meal.   I'd go back. Hi Yang factor - good place to impress your Platinum card status on a 'date.' Dress up, enjoy. 5 stars.

      I agree with an earlier review that this food here is just too abstract to be good.  The best food has the simplest ingredients that work together.  This place tries too hard with convoluted recipes that confuse rather than please the palate.  The tasting menu was too adventurous even for me, someone who's always willing to try something new. There were several simpler dishes that stood out - crispy langoustines, rack of lamb, oysters, and dover sole. Then there were others that were poor combinations - stuffed salmon, le burger, fried egg with salmon roe, sea bass. The worst were their desserts, which the french are supposed to be known for.    Atmosphere is cold and not cosy, esp. avoid the high tables and chairs.  I was brave and took 3 other poor souls there to try it for the first time.  Our bill was $830 including wine, tax and tip.  Almost made us swear off fine dining and hit the Wynn buffet next time we're in sin city!  We enjoyed our prior experiences at Bouchon, Boulud, and Rosemary's much more than L'Atelier at the fraction of the cost.

      Gas $4+/gallon? Yeah, that's not much fun any but at least it crept up slowly. The end result is that more and people are starting to conserve by buying a Prius, avoiding unnecessary driving and taking public transportation.  L'Atelier's menu prices hit you over the head like a gas station billboard.  $45 for flank steak? $40 for risotto? $70+ for many other items? That is sticker shock!  I even peeked next door to see the Robuchon restaurant tasting menu - $250p.p. I know this is Vegas but WOW.  Money aside, this place has incredible food. I almost wish I'd gone for the tasting menu but we did the ala carte/tapas option. EVERYTHING was amazing. Though I complained about the flank steak, it's wagu and about as tender and flavorful as a rib eye or fillet. The crab salad is actually exceptional value as the crab is piled on. All in all L'Atelier is a culinary delight that will impress any foodie.  Service wise - it's great. Actually "unparalleled" would be a better way to say it. Especially for bar service. Couple that with the casual but elegant setting and you've got a winner here.  All in all this is 100% a five star place but Joel needs get a little more reasonable on prices or people will drive their Prius elsewhere.

      one of the most amazing meals i have ever enjoyed.  i took my boyfriend to vegas for his birthday and set up L'Atelier as his birthday dinner.  From start to finish, the service and all our dishes were absolutely amazing.  We started our meal with the baby kushi oysters poached in french butter and the lobster gelee in a cream leak soup, which both were amazing.  order the big eye tuna in tomato infused olive oil.  it is a really wonderful dish.  then we had the roasted rack of lamb which was so tender and juicy and we also ordered the gnocchi which were so tender and well prepared.  also the braised pork belly-- wow.  that has to be one of the best dishes I have ever tasted in my entire life.  order it and you will not be sorry.  the sweetbreads, which i stayed away from because i just cant do it...  but my boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed them and he said the dish was amazing.  please do yourself a favor and order the green chartreuse souffle with pistachio ice cream for dessert.  It is to die for.  I think if a restaurant can pull of a great souffle... they know what they're doing.  and no doubt, the chefs on the line here at L'Atelier, know exactly what they're doing.  Also as a treat, they surpised the birthday boy with a tray of 6 different tarts that were all absolutely delicious.  At L'Atelier, you will have a great experience and you will be thinking about the dishes you had here for weeks even months to come.  I ate there in March and I still think about the dishes I enjoyed there.  The tab came out to be around $500 for all the dishes and mind you, lots of wine.  Yes, a bit steep.  But for a great memorable meal, I dont mind dropping the cash for.

      Elf sized food for Giant prices!! I know small plates, but sharing?? you would need a tweezers to transfer to another plate. I asked for ice water upfront along w/ a $60 bottle of wine. I asked 3 timesfor a water refill-got filled half way--no ice. When I asked if they had ice-He said, "I can get some" like he was borrowing it from the neigbors, Waiter then returned with a glass of ice that he used his hands to pick up, some fell on my plate-hands again!!!!!!!!!!! My quail w/ foi gras had no foi gras--and was so t i n y-- I think a hummingbird leg, perhaps-that may have justified the price. $430.00 for 3 women, come on-really??? They were offended that we did not want to sit at the bar-but requested a table so we could talk. When asked about the Pommes frittes-the waiter said, just plain old French Fries! at that price? NEVER AGAIN.

      We didn't make reservation in advance since everything was sort of last minute.  Sitting at a blackjack table across from the restaurant in the afternoon, I mentioned that it is in the Michelin Guide and I would love to try it.  He, being such a gentleman, happily agreed and made the reservation for 7pm.  We were told that we would be seated at the counter; at first, I hesitated but was told that it is the thing to do.  Arriving at the restaurant on-time, we were seated right away.  The woman was right; it was definitely the way to dine here.  You get to observe the chef in action.  The restaurant is modern and chic.  The service was prompt, friendly and excellent, not at all snooty.  However, the price tag was definitely on the high side.  All 'tapas' style appetizers start around $20 and go up to $45.    We started with the grilled vegetables with buffalo mozzarella.  Absolutely delicious.  The vegetables were flavorful and the buffalo mozzarella was soft and subtle in flavor.  For main entree, he had the Scottish salmon stuffed with black olive cream.  The waiter told us the salmon would be cooked to about 60%.  Given that I don't eat salmon, I took his words for it when he said it was the best he's ever had.  I had the fresh cod fillet in morel broth. My oh my.  The cod was crispy on the outside, flaky and tender on the inside.  The fish was in a mild broth, surrounded by a few morel mushrooms and vegetables.  Absolute perfection.  For dessert, we shared the Le Chocolat which was very good but not as spectacular as some of the other stuff we had that night.  (Trevese with its white chocolate cloud is still my favorite.)  Without tip, the total came out to be $140+.  Since both of us had iced tea, it certainly was a ton of money.  However, the food and service was so excellent that I would recommend it if you have the money to spend.

      You know, maybe I'm not sophisticated enough to properly appreciate Robuchon's L'Atelier. And maybe my friend that I went with wasn't either. But needless to say, we didn't find the food here to be as excellent as others have - or even particularly enjoyable. We both did the tasting menu, and out of all the courses, we maybe actually enjoyed 2 - the "entree" part and the desert. The bread was alright too. But the rest of it was edible at best. I'm really not sure how much else I can say about this, but underwhelmed doesn't begin to describe it.  The service however, was good, and I definitely can't complain there. Ambience was nice. We sat at the bar. It's a tight fit up there, and it could be a little awkward if you're not there on a date (etc), especially if you're tall.  All said and done, I'm not likely to return to L'Atelier. Maybe if I really wanted to impress a snobby girl. One good thing did come from it though - I'll never have to worry about spending $300 a head at Robuchon's "real" restaurant.

      Not just superb food, but a completely fab experience as well.  I took a foodie friend who was as game as I was to really enjoy the experience (this is not the place to take that whiny friend who wants sauce on the side, bitches about salt or complains that they can drink a whole bottle of wine for $2 at home...spare me.)  This is foodie bliss.  Sitting at the counter is fabulous -- how clever to take the personalization of a retro diner where Pearl serves coffee and slings hash and jack it up on foodie steriods, cross it with a sushi bar experience and deliver a completely upscale, fun, personal connected couple of hours in a place many would assume they'd feel intimidated.  Pearl is no longer a hash slinger...but a hot, well trained server who makes you feel like a queen (or king) and walks you through the Robuchon experience with aplomb... the counter behind him is where a bevy of chefs is busy plating and prepping, making magic -- it's great theater -- a perfect evening's complete entertainment -- so don't go when you're in a rush or have to catch a show or need to be anyplace else but right there -- truly enjoying every moment...  We decided to create our own tasting menu out of the small plates listed on the menu -- our server was completely on board -- he suggested wines when our glasses were empty, sent surprises from the chefs for us to taste (because it was clear we were in heaven) and gave us lots of fun inside tips -- steering us towards dishes he knew we'd like as he watched us eat and began to understand our palates, and moved us away from others... and he read us like a book!  We loved every bite...  First, L'AMUSE-BOUCHE Cucumber gele tarragon cream, cumin yogurt    (sent from the Chef -- this is part of the regular tasting menu and isn't on the a la carte -- but is a signature of Robuchon's and was delicious...)  LA TOMATE  Chilled gazpacho with croutons (this was probably the best gazpacho I've ever tasted -- it isn't chunky but pure essence of tomatoes, perfectly seasoned -- cold -- wonderful.  I still dream about this and wonder where they get their tomatoes in the wintertime... do not share this...  LE JAMBON  "Prosciutto" ham served with toasted tomato bread  -- we shared this -- I love Spanish pan con tomate -- and this was simliar but better.  LA LANGOUSTINE  Crispy langoustine fritter with basil pesto  -- these were lovely and perfect to share (if you have to...)  LES HUITRES  Poached baby Kussi oysters with French  Echir  butter -- these are so good you won't want to share them -- they're the tiniest cutest oysters I've ever seen -- and poached in butter...I get shivers remembering how delicious this was.  LA VENTRECHE  Lightly seared tuna belly with crispy onion rings  Yes, onion rings and tuna -- perfect texture balance...  LE FOIE GRAS  Traditionally poached cold foie gras served with toast  We can't get enough foie -- and this was terrific torchon...  LE FOIE GRAS  Seared duck foie gras with cherries and almonds We each ordered a foie dish and shared it -- seared is always my favorite --   LE BURGER  Beef and foie gras burgers with lightly caramelized bell peppers   Because we were on a foie mission, our server told us that these were not to be missed -- they were tiny burgers with seared foie -- I don't even want to think or know how many calories because they were perfect bites of toe curling yumminess...next time, I might not share...  LA CHARTREUSE  green chartreuse souffl, pistachio ice cream  I ordered this -- I love chartreuse -- it's so misunderstood so seeing it turned into a dessert I thought sounded very interesting -- it was.    LE CHOCOLAT  Chocolate sensation,  crmeux  Araguani, Oreo cookie crumbs   See?  who says the French are food snobs -- Robuchon uses oreos!  You gotta love that.   This was really decadant and a lovely finale...  Yes, we were stuffed, giggly, had made great friends with our cohort at the counter who had just come off of a ten day horseback tour of the west and was dining alone -- until he chatted us up!    Ask how happy we were to be in our own little foodie heaven when a sea of humanity after a huge fight poured out of the MGM arena and we could avoid being caught up in that wave of crazy...    Do take a cab after this experience...it's impossible, if you love food &amp; wine as I do, to not get caught up in the experience and be well....a tad over-served...    The two of us spent with tip and wine, $500 -- yep...  that's why you absolutely cannot go with someone who won't appreciate the moment - or will faint when the check comes.   Live a little...this is a great place to do it...!  Update:  3/31/08 -- our anniversary!  Actually got to come w/ the Husband last night -- and had a blast!  Thank you Eric, Mike, Simon, Chef -- flawless evening -- loved every bite!     Favorites tonight:  service, the cold lobster soup, every bite of foie, perfect wine pairings! (I took pics above!)

      My husband is in the military and in the 6+ years we've been together, we havent spent many Valentine's Days together so he really wanted to take me out somewhere special especially since we were in Vegas! So, he did his own research and made reservations for here.  We were promptly seated at the counter in which you could see into the kitchen and watch things be cooked and plated--was really neat! We ended up ordering the tasting menu which was an experience in its own. The only thing I did not like was anything with fois gras, but everything A+! Stellar! It was the most expensive meal I've ever had and truely 100% enjoyable. The cook who took care of us was also SUPER attentive and gave us the heads up and the best ways to get around Vegas (we were going to a show after dinner and had planned to walk, but he directed us to the metro which was MUCH faster).  Great food, great service, I'm sold!
