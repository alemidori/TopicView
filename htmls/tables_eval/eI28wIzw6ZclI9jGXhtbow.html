      This is a must see show. Old world variety/cabaret with a modern twist. Just like classic Commedia Dell'Arte Absinthe revels in the baseness of humanity to get us to laugh at ourselves while highlighting how amazingly awesome we can also be. Cirque fans will love seeing world class acts up close and comedy fans will love how edgy and risky the vibe is. This show makes you literally hoot and holler. It's been four days since I've seen it and I'm still high from the experience!

      Vegas shows used to be all about tits, ass and feathers...but somewhere in the last 10 years the scene was hijacked by a pretentious gang of artsy-fartsy Quebecois poseurs who want us to believe we are experiencing high-brow art. NEWSFLASH, dumbasses: it's still tits, ass and feathers! OK, so the tits are the flat, athletic kind...and the makeup is conceptual....but still. Same shit, different show: O, KA, Le Reve, Love, Mystere, blah blah blah blah blah.  Absinthe is the polar opposite of all those pretentious Cirque extravaganzas. It's in a little outdoor tent in front of Caesars Palace, and the stage is only about 8 feet in diameter, so no matter where you're sitting, you are in immediate danger of being hit by flying Russians and roller skates. No safety net, no smokescreens, no remove at all between audience and performers... and lots of swearing. That's the Russian way!  The show is billed as an adult carnival, and it's basically an old-time circus acrobat revue chock-full of hot hardbodies fresh from the Eastern Bloc, with a few lip-synced burlesque numbers and some obscene banter between the emcee (the Gazillionaire) and his ditzy assistant Penny. But despite its humble premise, it's AWESOME! The hot Russian acrobats, as mentioned, are flipping and flying and skating and tight-rope-walking right over your head, and the tent is so small that you can hear every grunt and groan and joint popping. It is a much needed dose of realism on a street packed full of fake-ass dreams.  My favorite part, though, is the obscene banter. I love me some dirty talk, and any show that has an 18+ age restriction is OK by me! I'm tired of listening to washed-up baby-boomers make corny, family-friendly  jokes to appease their corporate masters... it's about f*ckin' time someone tried something different!    In summation: if you're edgy, alternative, punk rock, Bohemian, artsy-fartsy or any of those annoying things (as I am), you'll dig this show.  This ain't no pantywaisted Cirque... this is Russian TSIRK! Long may it last!

      A fun adult variety act show with a atmosphere of a " Tim Burton" French circus twisted dream. The comedy is edgy and fun. The performers were all extremely athletic and talented.  What makes this show really exciting is the intimit nature of the circus tent. It is a really small tent so it feels like the performers could slip at any moment and land on your lap.

      Absinthe was a great, fun, quirky little show.   The show is in a tent located outside of Caesars Palace. That being said, the seating is a lot more 'intimate' than most other shows you'll watch in Vegas. I didn't mind it so much, but a lot of other patrons seemed uncomfortable with it. The one thing that I hated were the seats. They are wooden chairs and are not comfortable whatsoever. So be prepared to spend 90 minutes being uncomfortable.   As for the performances of the show, they were amazing. Similar to the Cirque shows available, but with their own little twists. I won't go into specific detail as to not spoil the surprise. But I will say the host of the show, ' The Gazillionaire' and his assistant Penny are hilarious, and a great addition to the show. Their jokes definitely do not stay on the politically correct side of things, so if you get offended easily, it's not a show for you.   Also, since the tent is so small, every seat available is a good seat. And on the same note, seating is first come first serve, so if you would like a seat in the first row or a seat in the aisle, go early.

      When you walk up, eyebrows raised, you're not really sure what's going on here or what to expect.  The beer garden is interesting, but once you make your way into the tent, wooden plank floors, the smell of an old wooded cantina.....you feel like you are in an old jankity tent.  But it's soooo cool!  Sit in the front, you might get picked on to do a lap dance or something else you would be embarrassed doing all in exchange for free Absinthe booze..... or if you want to see your life flash before you....up close and personal is an understatement!  There is a rollerskating couple who I swear, I'm going to keep them in my prayers everyday that they don't die during their routine.  Go see it quick before something happens to them, it's CRAZY! Don't be offended by the racist, sexist, rude, or raunchy remarks by the 'host'.  One word.....fun!  I can't wait to go again.

      Absinthe is a great 90 minute show.  The acts are quite dazzling and daring--strong men doing amazing lifts and balancing, a roller skating couple, aerial act, and much more.  Think V Variety Theatre meets Zumantiy, with a zany MC, the Gazillionaire, and his peppy sidekick, Penny.  When I entered the beer garden area, open to the public, I was intrigued by the decor or lack thereof.  Bathtubs made into seats, assorted lights and letters to spell the name of the beer garden, whimsical lights--it has a little of everything.  If you know someone who can get you a VIP ticket, take it.  I was VIP last night.  You get to enter a private lounge.  Access is through a green telephone booth.  Once you show your ticket, you step into the booth, pick up the phone, and when someone on the other side picks up, say anything you want.  He'll let you into the VIP area.  There's another bar in there and you get 1 free drink ticket with the VIP seating.  I had a great time chatting with people from out of town.  And, it's a relaxing area decorated in an eccentric manner a bit muted compared to the outside garden.  VIP ticket holders are allowed into the circular building first, so this guarantees you the seat of your choice.  I took a front row seat, and it was great.  Being the 3rd person in the theatre has its perks.  I was also "picked on" by the Gazzilionaire a bit.  All in good fun and for lots of laughs--no lap dance from Penny.  The acts are dazzling.  The performers are very talented.  The show is almost exactly 90 minutes.  The seats are wood, so they begin to feel uncomfortable after awhile.  They are also hooked together with lock ties so you can't get a bit more room from your neighbor.  This is because the stage is relatively small and the performers are coming in and out through small aisles.  I highly recommend this show.  What an addition to the lineup of shows in Las Vegas.  At $69 before taxes and fees, this show is less expensive than many on the Strip.  Go and enjoy!

      Dear Absinthe,  THANK YOU. SO, SOOO MUCH.  This show has to be the BEST thing to happen to The Strip since Frank Sinatra. Yes, you heard right. The amazing variety of the format, from a beautiful Burlesque singer, to death-defying roller skating, chair-stacking and no-net high-wire numbers leaving the audience at first terrified for their own safety, followed by spontaneous and uproarious standing ovations. All rolled along smoothly by an outrageously funny, improv-genius MC duo.  One of the coolest features of Absinthe has got to be the century-old Spiegeltent housing the show, and the kooky/magical beer garden outside. There are thousands of mirrors adorning the structure, and a ring of stained glass windows above the audience. If Vegas is about fantasy, you are definitely transported to a world unlike any other you can find around town, without feeling like you're on a ride at Disneyland.  The show's star (and I say star because other than the MC's, she's the only performer who appears multiple times) is the singer, whose real name is Melody Sweets (she plays the Green Absinthe Fairy). Not only is she gorgeous and engaging to every single audience member in the tent, but I found out that the songs she sings -- and does stripteases to, yum -- are her very own originals!! I thought at first she might be lip-syncing, but then she says snarky little things to the folks in the front rows, like getting them to snap their fingers, and you soon realize that she's just hands-down a great singer. Okay okay, so I was a little taken with her, but I bet you will be too!!  Amid all the the beauty and acrobatics and vintage atmosphere, the real grease that keeps this mile-a-minute show squeaking by with a wink and a nod are the funniest MC combo since Martin and Lewis...their names are the Gazillionaire, whose limitless money is supposedly funding the show, and his adorable assistant Penny, whose ditzy antics quickly take a turn for the dirty and hilarious. They both seize upon audience members with breathtaking spontaneity, making you feel like the particular 85-minute show you are attending is unique...which, of course, it is.  Insider's tip: if you can't get VIP tix, get there early to line up, as it's first-come, first-served seating and you definitely want to be in the front rows!! Don't sweat the wait; grab a beer and soak in the atmosphere outside the tent...  It's allll part of the show, folks.

      Awesome show! High-paced variety acts, fun hosts, audience interaction. I was on the edge of my seat (yes fairly uncomfortable wooden chair, but oh well) most of the show. The performers are crazy, the roller skating act is almost worth it alone...holy yikes!!   Is it ok for kids? ABSOLUTELY NOT. Also, not recommended if you offend easily. Crude jokes galore!   We got $54 (incl tax/fees) tickets from one of the Half Price Ticket vendors inside the Fashion Show mall, near TI.   I would recommend getting to the beer garden area about an hour before the show, hang out and have some drink and enjoy the atmosphere. It's a general admission show, so everyone lines up and you pick your own seat. We were pretty far back in line so I was afraid we would get crappy seats but we still ended up in the 3rd row. I'd say there isn't a bad seat in the venue since its a round center stage.   I have recommended it to all my friends!

      Not for the timid or easily offended, this show is a hoot.  Sexy, naughty and nasty,  which just happened to be some of my favorite things.  Great performances with a tremendously funny host and super sexy- silly hostess.  Some very original acts that I haven't seen in other shows, plus a few familiar favorites.   Definitely recommend it for those who like something a bit different and more edgy.

      GO SEE THIS NOW!! Acrobats + Burlesque + Naughty Comedy + Cabaret +Awesome Venue! Zumanity's edgier, funnier kid brother! Never been to a show where the standing ovation was so quick, automatic and sustained!  This is the BEST show ever. Though lovely, I've gotten sleepy eyed at many Cirque shows -- but not here! Everything about this show, from the moment you walk into the beer garden to when you exit is designed to transport you to another place and time. The ambiance totally makes you forget you're in Vegas in the middle of the Strip.   The show is held in a sectioned off portion of the Caesar's Palace near Serendipity called "Spiegelworld." When you're about to enter, there is no hint of what to expect beyond the gates. Once in, you're immediately struck by the Tim Burton-like set featuring a central "tree house" constructed from metal railings, chairs, birdcages and a spiral staircase. The string lights add a whimsical, carnival-like feel. Dotted around the grounds are various tables and chairs made from various odds and ends like bathtubs and wooden crates. This area is called the beer garden.  When we entered there was already a line even though we arrived 30 minutes early. From my understanding, all seats are general admission. Even though we were near the end of the line, we got fabulous seats only 3 rows from the stage and didn't miss out on getting some great beer.  For anyone who has ever seen Cabaret the musical, this show will be totally up your alley. Cabaret has the Emcee; Absinthe has it's Gazillionaire. He's really the driving force behind the feel of the show. He's kitschy, naughty, hilarious and has incredible chemistry with his assistant Penny.  The performances are fantastic. Of particular magnificence were the skating duo (amazing!), the strong men acts and the parody-performance by the Gazillionaire and Penny.      Though we got same day tickets at the 1/2 price vendors, the show was so good I would have gladly paid double. Shows are Tuesday to Sunday, dark on Mondays.

      Do not miss this show! It was one of the coolest shows I have ever seen in Las Vegas. The stage is so small you feel like you are in the middle of the act and that just doesn't happen a lot in Vegas. Try getting your tickets across the street at Bill's Gamblin Hall Tix4Tonite booth and save $20 bucks like I did.

      I was really surprised at how well this show was put together. The first thing though is the really cool beer garden that has beer pong, cornhole and shuffleboard outside. But anyways back to the show. The show is held inside an Antique retrofitted Spiegel tent that fits 800 people. The seats are pretty uncomfortable and have very narrow aisles. Also it is first come first serve seating. So, don't show up late!!   The show itself is really how I feel Cirque should of approached Zumanity. Lots of Adult humor, don't take itself too seriously, make it sexy, make it fun and create an intimate environment. There is not a bad seat either since it is only about 10 rows deep. The roller skaters are probably the coolest craziest thing I have ever seen. It truly leaves you in disbelief and the Gazillionaire is really funny too. Angel from Holly's World is now in the show too and her boobs make a nice cameo appearance.  Not a 5 star really because it is not comfortable viewing and the lack of assigned seats.

      I went to this show tonight and it was funny!!! Some real hot european girls in it as well.... the host of the show was great, made me laugh my ass off as well as this comedic "silk act".... the show is basically Cirque Du Soleil style in a small tent in front of Ceasers Palace..... also this guy and girl act on roller skates was real neat.

      Simply put, one of the BEST live shows I've ever seen.  In Vegas for a bachelor party, seven of us headed to the Half Price Tickets booth to find a deal for a burlesque show of some sort (only criteria was boobs, really). Thankfully one of the ticket agents started raving about Absinthe, and he hadn't even seen it yet! This supported by a quick check against Yelp reviews, and we had seven tickets in hand (well, not really; you get a receipt that you exchange for the tickets at Caesar's). I think we paid $48 per ticket.  In any case, the big top is located in a fenced-in area adjacent to Caesar's Palace, and is honestly a great waiting area. A small but excellent offering of draught beers are on tap (Chimay and Kronenbourg 1664), and there're lots of seating splayed about. Arrive at least 30 minutes before the show, and do make an effort to get into line early. The seating is general admission, and we were very pleased sitting in the third row. Note: I would avoid the seating area directly opposite from the main entrances; parts of the performance take place near/behind this area, and I noticed some patrons had to turn right around to watch.  I went into the show completely dumb about the kind of acts I would see, so I won't go into that detail here (the surprise added to the thrill of the performance). I'll just say that there will be singing, humour, and tons of acrobatics. One of the acts had me feeling incredibly anxious (and not a lot gets a stir out me), with other patrons literally being unable to watch.   Finally, not only were there boobs, but these women were gorgeous, and incredibly fit and athletic. Not to be out done, the shirtless male performances reminded us of how pathetic we all are, as we downed our beers. This really is a show for both sexes, and I've been damn near adamant that a friend's bachelorette party see this when they're in Vegas soon.  Our voices were coarse by the end of the spectacle from all the hootin' and hollerin'. There's no doubt in my mind that this topped any show we could have seen in Vegas - burlesque, Cirque, or otherwise!

      This show was a BLAST!  One of the best live shows I have seen so far.  It has everything acrobatics, comedy, and great seating.  We heard such good things about it and we are so happy we gave it a try.  The beer garden was a great place to relax while waiting for the doors to open, but the drinks are overpriced.  I would recommend walking right outside to the Bacardi Bar if you want cheaper drinks.  If you are looking for a great show...YOU MUST SEE IT!!  I saw some of the prior posts about uncomfortable seating, but I wasn't uncomfortable at all.  The isle's are a bit narrow but I walked freely without hitting anyone so they are wider than a movie theater.  We were the 6th people to line up at the door so we had excellent seats on the 3 row.  Be sure and start lining up 30 min. before the show (no assigned seating). The show itself makes you feel like you are part of the action.  And some lucky audience members did get to participate.  The comedy was really funny...not cheesy at all like I was expecting.  Some of these performers are beyond words.  It truly is a show you just have to see to appreciate.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!

      Amazing!  Stop searching and go buy tickets!  I bought these last minute and couldn't have been happier about the whole experience.  It is as good (actually better in my opinion) than any Cirque shows.  Why?  Because it is funny, edgy, and acrobatic.  Also we waited until almost everyone had lined up and we still had great seats!!!!  It was truly entertainment at its best.

      ABSINTHEloutly a must see! Escape the douchiness of the Vegas club scene at the "beer garden" which literally kisses the edge of the Strip. Near Ceasars Palace? Detour now pedestrians. Anyone can enter the quirky drinking arena for some relaxing libations combined with an outstanding eclectic music mix ranging from punk to hip hop and beyond-no cover charge-drink prices decent for being on the strip. I will come back simply to hang here for cocktails, friendly conversation, smart music mix and street smarty/arty/carni vibe. My advice is to arrive EARLY, walk around, explore and absorb what this drinking area has to offer. BAM! We're off to a great start, and the show has yet to begin. Absinthe is simply-beautiful, flirty, comedic, and dirty. The round stage can't be more than 15 feet in diameter, with a mere 5 rows of seats circling the stage, elevating the thrill factor ten fold. There are some serious acrobats and other circus acts that are nothing short of mesmerizing, and are appreciated even more with everyone's up close seating. The intimacy adds to the level of danger and excitement. Seriously, one slip, and....well...never mind. Lets just say there are no safety nets-I like that. The tent is also beautifully done, creaky hardwood floors, square wooden-almost elegant tent poles, red velvet booths line the perimeter of the tent, with matching red velvet at the dome. Think hints of Bourbon Street, and 19th century traveling shows. The ring leader/Gazillionaire is Don Rickles meets Andy Kaufman's alter ego Tony Clifton. Penny is a hilarious cutie a la a raunchy Gracie Allen. Leave your political correctness at the door please. Oh! The music...jeeze...Doris Day, to Wild Beasts, to Bon Jovi, Bobby Darren, Muse, The Hollies, Tbilisi Symphony Orchestra, and Susan Boyle, just to name a few. Smart and silly, quirky and cirquey with a little burlesquey. Yeah, I kinda liked it.

      Since this was our first time in Vegas and there were so many shows to choose from, we did a lot of research. Based on Yelp reviews, we chose Absinthe.  Boy, what a riot!!!  From the beginning to the end, we were entertained.  Gazillionaire and Peggy were hilarious.  The "bodyguard" duo was  amazing.  And the rollerskater duo was crazy.  I would definitely recommend Absinthe to anyone who is visiting Vegas.

      Best show I have ever seen in Vegas. Its a great mix of insult comedy, cirque du soleil level acrobatics just a few feet from your chair. Plus a little burlesque thrown in for good measure. The Gazillionaire and Penny are so funny my side was hurting from laughing.  Well worth the $49 ticket price for locals.  i'm going to see if again next week. I rarely see a show more than twice. But I get the feeling this show will be a little different every time.

      Sexy time... Oh yeah!  Imagine that being purred with a eastern European accent and you've summed up my sentiments.  I'm not a big "show" person. I suffer from a slight case of ADD and cringe when forced to watch lengthy performances on TV, let alone the live version. Actually, I'm kind of famous for ducking out of most live shows early no matter what. Seriously, I don't even know what happens in the third act of Les Miserables - and who really cares? Based on the first two acts and the setting, I figure they all die anyway.  But I digress. Absinthe didn't have me too worried - I had barely gotten off the plane and was whisked away to a Cesar's Palace circus tent. No time to hem and haw about this one. Based on the flea market aesthetic of the outdoor "lobby" (complete with shuffleboard table) and the fact that they're slinging drinks before you even get to your seats, this was already shaping up to be a good night.   As most have already said in their reviews, the show itself is a mixture of comedy, acrobatics and vaudeville. It's definitely not for the uber-conservative crowd that's seeking a Celine Dion-esque experience. Think: pasties, repeated use of the "f word", a sock puppet sex simulation and the slightest peek of a dude's junk. No, I would not take my parents here. Your parents, however, might be into it... it just depends.  From start to finish, I think the show lasts about an hour and a half? Just the right amount of time. I laughed. A lot. And I couldn't keep my eyes off the stage, which is a sign that it's more than enough entertainment for one person.

      Absinthe is a fantastic show!!  A group of us went to the 9:30p Saturday night show. We took advantage of the $49/ticket locals special. I believe it's good through the end of June 2011.  WOW it such a fun, sexy, crazy show! Like others have commented, the seating is first come, first serve so don't let Ticketmaster tell you otherwise. They almost messed us up had we not decided to just go early anyway. Our group consisted of 5 people so it was worth it to arrive 40 mins early (the line was slightly long) but we were able to all sit together in the 4th row. That was close enough to enjoy the show. The "tent" venue is very small. The stage is teeny tiny, but that's what adds to the show's atmosphere.  I am not an absinthe-alcohol fan (I don't care for the black licorice taste) so I sipped on a jack and diet coke. Definitely having a drink to loosen up helps as some of the jokes and comedy are very off-color (i.e. visuals of a unicorn with male genitalia on its head instead of a horn) with a good measure of racism. I wouldn't recommend this show for children/teens or ultra-conservative adults. That said, it is a hilarious show and if you are aware of what the show consists of going in you will enjoy your experience.  Our absolute favorite portion of the show were the rollerskaters. When you see the show, you will know what I'm talking about! :)  All the performers were outstanding and the entire cast really works their buns off during the entire show. No slackers or lagging performances here. Go see it!

      Utterly spectacular.  I've been to quite a few shows (Love, Peepshow, Zumanity, Crazy Horse, Jubilee...) and this one was one of the best!  Get there an hour early and enjoy the beer tent.  Chimay on tap and cornhole set up in the courtyard.  My only negative comment - the show is an hour and a half long.  The rows are awkward at best to get out of, and for the last half hour you aren't allowed to use the aisles because part of the act is in the aisle.  So ladies - make sure you use the rest room before the show!!

      This show absolutely deserves all 5 stars, and it's fitting that it currently averages 5, it's amazing awe inspiring and jaw dropping.  It's hilarious and there is both raunch humor shock value and acrobatic shock value (roller skaters!!!) My big group and I kept quoting the jokes and raving nonstop about the routines, especially the skaters who we've been watching on endless look on youtube!   The whole cast is so sexy, too! Which doesn't hurt. i thought the burlesque style girl in all her emerald green and katy perry esque dark hair was absolutely gorgeous!  This show is just about perfect; the only caveat I'd add is DON'T TAKE YOUR KIDS! Go with grown ups.   Seriously obsessed with the roller skaters! And the guys who went from security guard to acrobats were amazing as well, the two emcees were super funny.

      THE best show I have ever seen in Las Vegas. The show was recommended to us by a helpful cabbie and we couldn't have been more pleased. The show is unpretentious and doesn't take itself too seriously which is a welcomed change from the snooty pretentiousness of modern Vegas. It's sort of Cirque-esque with some acrobatics and death defying acts (the roller skating people were intense!). The intimiate setting of the show is ideal for the performances as they are literally a few feet in front (or above) you. In some instances, audience members are advised not to stand up or talk b/c that is literally how close and personal the show is.   The show has some (tasteful) nudity and some singing numbers. Be sure to get your tickets from Tix4Tonight. We got tickets for 51 (at the box office it was 69). Arrive early to get the best seats (but be warned, if you sit in the front you may get picked on by the hilarious Gazillionaire)!

      By far the best show in Vegas. The only bad thing is the seats.  They are tight and very uncomfortable. Once you get past that this show is funny, jaw dropping, amazing, OMG incredible. You are so close to the action its amazing no one in the audience gets hurt. And the performers are incredible. I don't know how to say it any other way. GO SEE IT!

      Loved the show, especially the small, up close and personal setting.  When the MC (the Gazillionaire) says don't stand up, or you'll get kicked, he isn't kidding.  Can be a little raunchy, and definitely not for the strait laced types, with the barely there pasties, but a fun show.  Acrobatics are the forte, the singing was so-so, but a good transition from the various acts.  Loved the bubble girl too.

      This show was so much fun!    Definitely get the VIP tickets so you can go through the green telephone booth and get free cocktails!!!  You also get priority seating with these tickets and get to swing in hammocks and sit in old creepy dentist chairs in a secret room :)  This show had the coolest acrobatics, my favorite was the couple on roller skates.  Angel Porrino (from "Holly's World") is in one act that is pretty cute.   You will not be disappointed by this show and afterwards you can go in Caesar's and win a bunch of money.
