      Update: After my somewhat favorable review, I've lowered the rating after staying here this past weekend. My friends and I decided to leave after one night b/c our room developed this "pee" smell -- which made us rename the place, the Imperial Pee-lace.

      Okay, so the Imperial Palace is definitely not the swankiest, nor the newest, nor the funnest place to go in Vegas. But it has one kitschy, old Vegas thing going for it - the Dealertainers. Don't get me wrong, it's not for everyone, but I love it. After a while, all those new places start to feel the same, look the same. The Dealertainers are black jack dealers that are tier 2 (okay maybe 3) level impersonators. They all deal cards and take turns going up on the mini stage to belt out songs - mental note, look for the speakers and DON'T sit in front of them. I had the pleasure of playing cards with Tina Turner, Stevie Wonder, Debbie Harry, Louis Armstrong, Billy Idol, and someone who may have been a very bad Mariah Carey (it was unclear). Anyway, go there for a different twist on cards - they had $5 minimum tables on a Saturday night - which is a rare find on the strip.

      I can only say great things about the IP. Not only do they have a section of card dealers that are dressed up like celebrities and launch into song every 15 minutes, but they also had the only $5 blackjack table that we could find on the strip. Important when you are planning to lose every dollar you gamble.  I also have fond memories of this place because I stayed there on my first trip to Vegas for the Millenium New Years Eve when I was 20 and 11 months old. The Imperial Palace was the only place we could gamble by putting on our older friends wristbands. That being said, I can't recommend the actual hotel rooms. But it doesn't matter if you are out all night!!  Good on you, IP.

      what brigid said.  the ip is where it's at for the cheapest gambling on the strip.  however, i hear that they recently got rid of the wheel of madness (tm)!!!   that sucks because there is nothing like getting blackjack and spinning the wheel of madness (tm). NOTHING.  it can cause you to stay at the ip until 5 in the morning when your plane leaves at 6 and you know that you did the right thing whether you make the flight or not.

      This place is awesomely dumpy!  The only reason we even bothered staying here is because it was $25 a night.  It's also in a prime location on the strip so we could get the hell out and into much better hotels really fast.  We tried our hardest to spend as little waking time in there as possible.  If you want a real laugh, check out their karaoke bar.  Their dealers are forced to dress up as musical acts, I'm pretty sure that violates some cruelty laws.  I'm pretty sure it's gonna get torn down soon.

      The best deal on the strip. Why pay $300 a night for some place you're just going to sleep in? This place has all the location advantages as the ripoff hotels (Bellagio, Wynn etc) without the stupefying price tag.   Trust me, no one's impressed that you can afford to stay at the Venetian. Stay here instead.

      If one cannot appreciate the atmosphere of this hotel, they do not belong in Vegas. The accommodations are the right price. The gimmick within the hotel is cheesy, but it comes with the territory. The pool is small and not all that impressive. The buffet is pretty good (which one isn't?) The location is the key to this property. It is nestled in between Harrah's and something owned by the Flamingo. I heard that this place was bought by Harrah's, but I guess it will remain it's own entity.   Anyway, I hope that you give it a chance. It won't disappoint.

      We reserved a room here for 2 nights and left after 1.  There was no fitted sheet over the mattress and the sheet they threw untucked over the mattress had holes in it.  They also left a room service cart in our hallway for an entire day and the smell of rotting food wafted about.  I would not recommend anyone stay here - there are plenty of good deals about in other higher quality casinos.

      Definitely not the fanciest hotel in Vegas. But, it is centrally located, right in the heart of the strip.   And it is cheap.  Vegas is not the kind of town where you spend a lot of time in the room, you know?  Get one person to stay at the Bellagio so you can hang buy the pool on Saturday (get there early), then go to Rehab at the Hard Rock on Sunday.   Spend your money on doing fun things, not your room.

      I know, I know, nobody really sleeps when they're in Vegas, so the hotel room shouldn't matter much... well, I do sleep, I like to take naps! My friends and I booked a room here two summers ago because we did not have much money and we wanted to be centrally located on the strip. While staying at Imperial Palace, we tried our best not to spend as much time in our room because it just felt really dirty, with a stained-blue carpet, thin (not 100% cotton) bedsheets and the base of the beds are attached to the floor -- a FLOORBED!  If you do end up staying here, try not to touch anything. Let's hope they will renovate soon, but before then, I will NEVER stay here again!

      You want $10 blackjack tables all night on weekends, dealers who make mistakes, and friendly pit bosses?  How about rooms under $100 on the strip?  Sure the place is a pit, the food is terrible, and they're knocking it down next summer, but enjoy it while you can.  It's Vegas, people, why are you in your room anyway?

      This place is NASTY.  The rooms are disgusting,  My husband and I stayed here unbeknownst to the conditions... we were stuck here for a few days.  Yeah.... you won't want to sleep here... or unpack your bags  I wouldn't let my dog sleep here.  The bed was awful.  The sheets smelled like sex and cigarettes (non-smoking room).  My husband and I each rolled to the center of the king-sized bed from it being so worn.

      They might as well rent out the rooms for 20 minute intervals.  Obviously all of the hotel's money goes to the casino and main floor remodeling.

      Never stayed here before, but we used to wander in here to go to theri 24 hour cafe for the 4.99 prime rib sandwiches. Alas, in the past trip we took, we were told that the 4.99 prime rib sandwiches were no more. :( still had a great 7.99 prime rib dip sandwich! =P  cheapest gambling place that i know of on the strip. the parking lot is miserable. we drove over from where we were staying in mgm and i was fearing for my life walking in from the parking lot. *shudders*

      This place is caught up somewhere between 1979 or 1982.  It is really bizarre especially if you check out the Burger Palace.  Really weird.  Anyway it is a cheap place to gamble and upstairs there is a retro (not on purpose) lounge complete with a piano man.  We ate at Ming which was cheap and decent chinese food.

      Seen some mixed reviews on this place but most of the bad ones stem from nasty rooms.  Stayed here this weekend but my room was clean and cheap.  I like to do vegas on the cheap and this is my kind of place, when i go to NYC, or LA I'll stay at a swanky hotel, and drink $15 drinks or do bottle service, but something about a guys trip to vegas demands that  my excess money be left on the tables, not spent on a nice room or a fancy club ( of course being engaged might have something to do with that).  So when I found the imperial palace, I knew I had a new favorite on the strip.  It's centrally located and the perfect place for beginning a bender

      I just happened to pass by for a cheap margarita in a yard container that costs only $15.  I love the drink.  Nothing to comment about this hotel, it didn't really appeal to me.  But I might check that out next time.

      they really should consider investing some money on this place and renovating the crap out of it. It's such a GREAT location on the Strip that i find it such a sad waste. i stayed here years ago because it was part of a really affordable package (also, for some reason, hotel only rates for this place can be pricier than you think i've noticed). the experience there was not horrendous, and found it easier to just laugh at the whole thing. the rooms are dank and musty, noisy since you have a lot of college meat running up and down the halls. and finding your room is a challenge, its a crazy maze of rooms on each floor. wear comfortable shoes. i tried my best to just fly by the casinos on my way out of the hotel each day. cesars and bellagio right across the street. once again, cant go wrong on the location. noticed a little bar downstairs called Tequila Joes...all i have to say is HAHHAHAHAHHA.   I would not stay there again. in vegas, you literally get what you pay for.

      Staying here reminded me of getting wasted and passing out in an outhouse and waking up wondering what the fuck went wrong.  Cheap and nasty - just be sure to stay out of your mind drunk when you are in the room so that all the germs covering everything will be sanitized by all the alcohol in your system!

      Great place for vegas on the cheap. Hope they keep it as it is! The location and price are the key to this place, right near all the great dining, easy walk to ceasars, venetian, wynn, paris, etc. Right on the monorail so any monorail stop is a short ride away. Not really a romantic couples place, but good for business or singles trip.

      This hotel is good if you come on X-Mas. Buy night, get one free. I would not stay here on any other time of the year. I would also NOT play in the casino. They have inpersonators of music icons like Michael Jackson, Madonna, &amp; Rod Stewert.
