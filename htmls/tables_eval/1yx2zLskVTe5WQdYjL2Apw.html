      I've only been here for breakfast/brunch and lunch, but it was an "egg"cellent experience every time.  Big portions, really friendly service, casual homey atmosphere.  They did a great job accommodating our large group (we called ahead to warn them we were on the way). It's a nice spot  to get away from The Strip and have some comfort food.  http://www.eggandi.com/

      if i'm gonna talk about finding great breakfast spots in SF, i have to give all something to compare. a real LV gem with one of the largest and most diverse breakfast and lunch menus i've ever witnessed. the  "homey" feel is exponentialized by the great service (a rarity in SF). and for those midwestern transplants searching for a little bit of home, check out the Cincy chili (served every way you can imagine, with the real deal stuff shipped straight from Ohio). god, i'm salivating like a damned Pavlovian puppy!

      My boyfriend and I went to this place really randomly when we went to Vegas for New Year's in December 2005. We found this place by looking in local ads. I know we each got omlettes and shared the french toast, and it was all very good. This will be the first place we go to if we ever go back to Vegas. The service was good and even though it was packed, we still received our food without the long wait you usually get in the bay area.

      This place is a winner on all accounts.  The food at the Egg &amp; I tastes great.  The service is spectacular, the people working there really make you feel at home.  Both the hostess and waitress were very friendly and fun to talk to.    As the name would imply there is a pretty good variety of egg dishes.  You get to choose from a good omelet selection, to huevos rancheros.  If you aren't in the mood for eggs they also have the usual sandwiches and burgers.  Get a side of the banana nut muffin its really good.  Vegetarian Rating: 4/5 lots of good veggie options, they even had a vegetarian version of Eggs Benedict.

      The Egg and I has been a staple of Vegas breakfast dining for years and is consistently lauded as one of the best places in town to getcher morning grub on.  It's easy to see why - this is just great, unpretentious food.  While it's fun to dine well in a dinner environment with tiny gourmet portions and fine presentations, for me breakfast is all about big portions and perhaps a little less regard to the appearance of the food.  It just needs to taste good and help wake your sluggish butt up.  The Egg and I offers breakfast staples - eggs, toast, pancakes, waffles, crepes, french toast, omelet, sausage, bacon - in various combinations and specialty skillets and frittatas as well.  Everything is always fresh, cooked to order, and served by a friendly wait staff.  I wish I lived closer, because I'd probably have their eggs benedict every day.

      This is a great place for a late breakfast. Their egg dishes are incredibly good. Their pancake and waffles are on the list too. My favorite is the Kay's special with the banana nut muffin. If you have a sweet tooth, you should definitely go for the muffin instead of the toast. It's fresh and moist.  This place is not on the cheap side (you know it's LV) but the food quality and service sure deserve it.

      gross, totally fawking gross.   after cruising by a couple times, and finally finding a coupon in our entertainment book, we decided to check it out late on a sunday morning.  upon walking in, you are greeted by little doodles with eggy little puns like 'eggcelent' and 'eggstravagant' teehee, you are also greeted by a behomoth of a host, hopefully not eating her breakfast at the counter like we found.  maybe her toddler will be standing there as well.  whatever, everyone needs money, baby sitters are sketchy, whatever.  its crowded, the decor is old, the clientele was pretty old too-but the menu looked ok, emphasis on freshness-which looked fine.  we usually dont frequent the greasy spoons, but the egg and i convinced us otherwise for the moment.  we sat outside, there were two other tables full out of about 7 total.  luckily for us, we got sat next to the propane tank cage (sweet) at the end of the patio.  we scanned the huge ass and confusing paper menu and our server came over.  it must've been his last day, this kid couldnt care less.    in preparation for a big breakfast rife with carbs and saturated fat my girlfriend ordered a fresh squeeze grapefruit juice..the response.   tweety bird tattoo-"its not fresh squeezed."  me-"eh?"  tweety bird tattoo-"its not fresh squeezed"  me-"it says right there, fresh...squeezed...juice"  tweety bird tattoo-"no, it comes from a bag"  me-"if its unsweetened ill take a glass"   fucking minute maid garbage, and at real juice prices, in a tiny juice glass that hits your nose when you drink.  so pretty much at that point, it all went to shit.   the wind picked up, one of their unsecured umbrellas nearly KO'd my girlfriend (thank goodness for that rusty propane cage!)  got a couple sorry's from some other servers, things happen ok.   the food arrived.  i ordered a veggie benedict, she had one of their eggy crepes with smoked turkey and avocado.   Hers:  on a huge oval plate 3/4 covered with the egg/crepe thing 1/4 with sysco brand diced homefries.  this was nothing more than ripping off IHOP adding pancake batter to their omelettes, terrible texture, horrible ingredients.  at the egg and i, avocado=thawed frozen guacamole from a bag.  her smoked turkey was of the school lunch variety, complete with the pretty little airbubbles viewed in the massive chunks. the cheese was orange-nuff said.   Mine:    honestly i do not understand difficulty surrounding hollandaise.  any brunch dawg can make it, there's not too many ingredients-its easy to break but hard to make taste terrible. i've heard of people using melted velveeta thru egg yolks, ive had the powdered crap, the traditional, all of it.  BUT I HAVE NEVER HAD ONE THAT TASTED LIKE CREAM OF CHICKEN SOUP WITH CHEDDAR.  luckily my two soggy ungrilled muffins came swimming in a gravy boat full of this hot ghetto mess.  more piles of sysco homies, some greasy looking pineapple, and the heatlamp wilted plouche of parsley to whisper  "it will all be better once you eat me (you idiot)"  the plate looked like a tijuana shrimp shack.    i was hung over, hungry, possibly still drunk, so i cut in-runny whites, sweet.   at this point we are utterly repulsed, complain to the manager.  we mention about their claims to freshness in relation to the juice, and got some quality backpedaling, when i brought up the sweet laser sorted frozen homefries, the poor lady replied:  "but they're fried.."  i almost fell outta my chair.   id give this place 0 stars, but they fully comped everything so i have to give them something.  save your money, go up the street to the hash house-shit dennys is better than this place.

      Service is always awesome!! Generous portions and down home feel.  Bomb greasy hangover food thats cheap.  They are not skimpy with the CHEESE or the AVOCADO which I love... And i like their cheesy nicknames.  I always try to go when I'm in da big LV.  Be careful if you are staying on the strip and catching a cab there.  They will take some EXTRA long roads.  Its actually easy to take the bus there if you are riding the deuce its free to get on bus.

      Cute menu format reads like a newspaper. The prices are reasonable and  food flavor is about the same as Denny's. However, I'd sooner drive cross town to this Las Vegas standby than go to my local IHOP or Denny's.  The service is average and the food is fair. It's a good place to bring your visiting friends so they feel like they're doing something "local." Generous portions- yes.

      5 stars for the BOMB homemade banana nut bread.... SOOOO good.  yes, sooooo good.  so good that I ended up buying a loaf and bringing it home as a gift to the guy who eats like cookie monster (doesn't eat only cookies like him, but devours food like him)!!!  All the other breakfast foods are good, eggs are cooked to perfection, clean restaurant, fast service - what more could you ask for?!?!

      Every time we go to Vegas we have at least one meal at the Egg and I.  The best breakfast joint in town.  They have this chicken enchilada omelette made of eggs, chicken, green chiles and cheese.  It takes EXACTLY like a chicken enchilada... you can't even tell it has eggs in it.  Damn good.  My last visit I had the pork chops and eggs, and my stomach wasn't even upset during the drive home.

      Killer breakfast at this place, and I'm not big on breakfast. I definitely enjoyed the giant selection on the menu.  You might not eat the rest of the day though--generous portions!  It's also away from the insanity of the strip--which I found favorable.

      We went to have brunch at egg and I this past Sunday. Fast service really good filling food. A great option to the buffets while visiting in Vegas. This will definitely be a place to go whenever we are in town. Our waitress was also really nice. Can't wait to go back to have the biscuits mmmm!

      An awesome local breakfast diner, a couple miles off the strip on Sahara.  Lots of cool touches like the newspaper style menus and the little flipcharts to let the server know you need something.  The breakfast skillets are superb here, served hot on the skillet with a layer of ranch potatoes.  I have tried both the Chili skillet and the Ultimate skillet, both were excellent.  I also recommend the banana nut muffin side.  I would, however, advise against ordering from their Mexican inspired menu.  They should definitely leave the chorizo con huevos to the Mexican joints.  Overall one of my favorite Vegas dining spots, for breakfast or a late night snack (they are open til 3AM).

      Went there this past weekend with the GF and my NY friends.  We had:  Blackened Prime Rib Benny - Blackened Prime Rib with onions and peppers and 2 poached eggs on a croissant with hollandaise sauce - Pretty good, but the prime rib was a little dry.  Eggs Benedict Florentine - Pretty good  Eggs Taliano - Very good, tasted like a pizza with a soft egg crust.  French Toast - This was ok.  All the egg dishes came with ranch flavored home fries which were geat.  This was a good breakfast place.  Very quaint and clean inside.  I would definitely go back there again.

      Oh. My. God.  I want to marry this place. I want to have its babies.  Stuffed French toast -- more like a French toast sandwich with eggs, bacon, and cheese -- total party in my mouth. The combination of sweet and savory was enough to make me die happy right there. The bacon and the scrambled eggs were perfectly blended (no limp strips of bacon criss-crossed on top of your eggs in THIS joint!) and the whole concoction dipped in syrup was like a MIRACLE.  Jess got a skillet and I have never SEEN more beautiful over-easy eggs. OHMIGOD! I wish this place were local, I would be here every weekend. The iced tea was good too, and the staff is friendly and helpful. This is probably where we'll come for a farewell brunch the morning after our destination wedding. Mission accomplished!

      I was sort of skeptical about eating here because it just looked another midwestern chain breakfast place.  I had the eggs benedict.  Really good and the eggs were perfect (not overdone).  My fiance happily shared the banana muffin which was really tasty.

      Terrific local place, varied menu, competent staff, GREAT FOOD, huge portions.  I figured out the LAS is not the cheap place for anything anymore.  Other half had the waffle - which was one of those big, thick, crusty ones- about 1 inch high.  Most places sell the wimpy 3/8th inch high waffle.  Killer home fries with some kind of chili/onion powder that came w/ my two eggs.  I felt our waitress was a little pushy, but she was just doin' her job.  All I wanted was the two eggs that came with potatoes.  She kept asking if I wanted sausage, or bacon.   Choice of English muffin or the 'to die for' banana nut muffin.  Too bad there's no place like this on the strip.  If there was, lines would be 10miles long. Keep in mind, ya need a car to get to this place.  I don't know about public transportation in this area.

      I don't think you'll be able to top this place in regards to price and portions.  The food is plentiful and the price is even better.  Best breakfast for under $10.  I got a half portion which was more than enough and it slashed that price by a third.  Their banana muffins are to die for and their wait staff is so friendly and sincere.  It's off the strip but well worth the trip.

      LOVE this place.  Went for brunch on a Saturday around 11am, only had to wait a couple of minutes while a table was cleaned.  Everyone who works there was terribly nice, and we loved the little egg sign that tells the staff if you need something. You must order the stuffed French toast!!  I'm not normally a French toast eater, but this is not normal French toast!  SO yummy, like the best sweet and hearty sandwich I've ever had - I could only get through half of it.  My friend had the eggs plus, which looked yummy, and a banana nut muffin that everyone raves about - it was awesome.  Their ranch potatoes are also amazing, like eating tiny square-shaped french fries. Everything is so well-priced.  We paid $26 including tip for both of us, and considering I had an orange juice, I'd say that's pretty great.

      I am acutally shocked to see how many stars people are giving this place!  We had to wait for a seat (which is not surprising given the # of stars people are giving this place), but the hostess and the waitress were really nice.  As soon as we were seated, we were approached by a man with very few teeth and food ALL OVER hs shirt!  He brought the cup of orange juice I asked for and the outside of the cup was covered with white gunk....not too sure what it was, but I was so grossed out I asked the waitress to please take it away.  I ordered the stuffed french toast because another yelper said it was like a "party" in her mouth.  I wanted a party in my mouth as well.......was it a party?  far from it.  It was just ok....and the potatoes were WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too salty.  Do not go here if you are not supposed to have salt or you will end up at Desert Springs Hospital....no joke!  The review below that compares the potatoes to BBQ chips from a bag is VERY true.....actually, my husband says it's worse than that.  This place gets 2 stars....

      The best thing is the Banana Nut Muffin! OMG it is TO DIE FOR! How good is it you ask?  My sister made me bring it back to San Diego for her on a business trip! I had to lug the goodness in the car all the way back to OC and then back down to SD! See the love for the muffin and for the sister! I delivered a muffin from so freaking far! lol  Yes, it is THAT GOOD! I still think about it that I drool and want to drive to Vegas again just for it! lol The muffin top is flat so more chewy crisp surface area.  We all know that is the best part!   Here are the dishes I recommend.  I have had a bunch of different ones but I only order the Piggy Skillet.  It's the best of all the meat worlds! They put Crisp Bacon, Diced Ham, Pork Sausage, Potatoes, Cheese, and Eggs.. how can you go wrong! Mmmmm meaty cheesy goodness! Yes you can easily make this at home but I want the muffins! lol  The Chicken Enchilada Omelette is pretty good too.  The chicken inside is tender and flavorful paired with all the condiments on top.  All the dishes are huge and plentiful.  I can never finish it, but that can also be that I scarf down as many muffins on the table and more! lol Still the food is pretty good and the seasoned potatoes are delicious! ^_^ Yum Yum.  If you are ever in Vegas, be sure to come try it out.  I think the design of the place is cute too, very wholesome! I like the mom and pop feel with cute sweet servers that are very attentive.  I have been back many times since and will keep coming back! Muffins!!! O=p

      At some point during breakfast, my husband started laughing at me.  It was probably the look of utter ecstasy on my face as I made sweet love to the banana nut muffin.  ... oh yeah, and the Italian omelette gave me such an upset stomach that the timeshare presenter freaked out and ended the presentation early.  That alone is worth the price of admission.  Five stars!

      I dig the atmosphere of this seemingly mom and pop breakfast joint. The food is good but nothing to write home about. It was packed with a line out the door on the Saturday morning we went.  I was able to try the combo meat skillet, beef hash skillet, and the stuffed french toast. Everything tasted homemade which places it above chain breakfast restaurants, but I think all cities have some sort of a joint that serves similar tasting dishes.  One thing that stood out was their banana nut muffin. Choose it over the toast, when asked what you prefer. This was the only thing that was better than anywhere else I have tried. I'm not a big fan of BNut, but if it tasted like the ones here, I would choose it every time.  Decent breakfast joint, decent prices. I might hit it again to try out different dishes to see if anything that can knock my socks off.

      Quaint and homey looking restaurant.  I kind of felt like I was getting a weird look at time, but it was probably in my head.  The food was delicious though as well as great portions.  The price was also affordable.  The breakfast burrito was quite tasty along with the turkey salad my girlfriend had.  The bran muffin was nice and hot.  The service was good.  I felt kind of pushed to get out though since they were closing soon.  However, it was still a nice and clean place with friendly service and good food.  Not much to complain about here.

      Very yummy.  The menu is many pages long and it includes many items I've never seen before like the chicken enchilada omelet or the fiesta skillet.  We ordered both of these items and they were so very good.  The enchilada omelet had a ton of sauce and cheese, a wonderful way to eat eggs!  The skillet had chorizo, chiles and a ton of cheese too, highly recommend ordering it.  The coffee was also piping hot and strong.  The service was ok, it took two tries to get glasses of water.  And yes I did try the banana nut muffin as others indicated and it was awesome with butter, only minus was the size, needs to be bigger!  I so wanted to give this place 5 stars but I couldn't because of the potatoes, here they fail because they have cut them it small cubes and they are hard but the worst part is the seasoning on them, super salty.  It bummed me because all the other food items were delicious.  I will be back and will just get a fruit plate instead of potatoes.

      Off the strip but soooooooooooooooooo good. Love this place --- and it's in Las Vegas only!  Just a few words that you need to heed:  Fresh. Banana. Nut. Bread.  OH YES.  The other items are great --- everything we had was so good. Skillets, omelettes, home fries (oh mmmmmmm yum), and eggs done to perfection. Wonderful service, friendly smiles, and great directions on the phone when we were trying to find the restaurant!  And their little egg logo is just SOOOO CUTE. What can I say? I'm such a sucker for branding!
