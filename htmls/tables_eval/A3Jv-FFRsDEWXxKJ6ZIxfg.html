      Went here last night to check it out as it just opened 2 nights ago. All i can say is it was a 9 out of 10 experience on every level. From the hostesses to the waiter to the wine and menu selections.  The food was FANTASTIC, and might be the best food I've eaten in Vegas. I got the roasted cauliflower soup and the mixed grill of filet, bacon wrapped prawns and lamb ribs. The sides of brussels sprouts and english pub fries were equally amazing!  Everything was out of the world!!  I'll be going back for sure. Check this "pub" out!!

      My birthday was coming up and I happened to hear about the opening of this restaurant. I have been to Gordon Ramsay Steak and it is amazing, so I knew right away where I wanted to go. I brought along 11 of my friends to share the experience.  The service is pretty fantastic. They all learn your name and take the time to chat, they even put on fake British accents when they heard us doing it. My water glass was never empty and they even had the entire restaurant sing happy birthday to me. There are two menus, the grill menu which is a bit pricier and the pub menu which has yummy pub food. We ordered off of the pub menu. Since we were such a large party, we tried a lot of food!  Fish and Chips - The fish is so buttery and melt in your mouth delicious! OMG! I didn't care so much for the garlic on the chips. I love garlic, but they tasted like they had been rubbed with raw garlic, not my favorite.   Shepherd's Pie - The mashed potatoes were so buttery delicious. Everything really worked well together, it was easy to see why this is a signature dish.   Duck Poutine - The fries and the duck gravy were phenomenal. There were bits of duck that were a little overdone so didn't add much to the dish, maybe if they were cooked a little less it would have worked a little better.  Trio of Pretzels with cheese and mustard - Two of us ordered this appetizer and the bacon cheese pretzel was fantastic! The mustard was a bit too spicy for my liking and the cheese spread it a little weird, but not too bad. This dish is not worth ordering because they bring the exact same thing to the table for free, except the free one has a small loaf of pumpernickel bread and butter instead of mustard. I can't believe they charge for this and then bring almost the exact same thing to the table for free.   Mac and Cheese - Almost everyone at the table ordered this and the response was 50/50. I was expecting a warm and rich mac and cheese, unfortunately, there was a really sharp cheese flavor which turned me off.   Short rib and Cheek sandwich - My friend ordered this and passed it around the table. The meat was tender and delicious and there was a horseradish sauce that really added a kick.  Sticky Toffee Pudding - You really must try this! It is absolutely delicious! Everyone at the table stole a bite and enjoyed it.  Overall, there were a lot of hits and some misses. We did have one big thing that turned me off a little. My sister in law ordered a burger, they forgot the bacon and then the burger was almost raw. She sent it back and by the time they brought the new one everyone was finished eating. She asked them to just box it up since we were finished. I would have liked to see that taken off the check since she didn't even get to eat with everyone, unfortunately this didn't happen and I was not comfortable asking.   There are some great dishes on the menu, the restaurant has a really cool vibe, and the service was pretty good. This is definitely a cool hangout for some yummy upscale pub food, but Gordon Ramsay Steak is where it's really at!

      We ate here on the 21st and 22nd, 3 days after the opening on the 18th.  Both times we ate at the bar, so can't comment on the restaurant side.  First night we came for drinks and a snack.  We had the Vic Queen Chips and Deviled Eggs.  Both were excellent.  The Chips were very delicate - thinly cut and perfectly fried - served with a side of malt vinegar for dipping.  Just excellent!!  The Deviled Eggs were served in an interesting way.  The egg whites were served separately, sprinkled with parsley, and the yolks were served in a small cup for you to scoop out and put as much as you wanted into the egg whites. The yolks were smashed and mixed with smokey bacon and cheese.   They were by far the best deviled eggs I have ever had.  In all, this experience was 5 star.  The second night we came shortly after 5 PM for the dinner menu.  We again sat at the bar.  They were out of the first beer that I ordered, but offered me a sample of another beer that I might like.  The bartender was very helpful.  We ordered the Fish &amp; Chips.  It took about 25 minutes for us to get our food, which is a little long, but we thought it might be due to a lot of folks ordering right around 5 PM when they start the dinner menu.  I figured if anyone could do fish &amp; chips right it would be Gordon Ramsay - however, I was disappointed in this meal.  It was definitely not the best fish &amp; chips that I had ever had.  The fish was OK, the batter was really good, but the fish was a little dry &amp; tough - like it had been overcooked.  I prefer fish that is more moist and flaky.  A thicker piece of fish would probably have held up better to the cooking.  The potatoes were the biggest disappointment, though.  We expected chips (french fries) what we got were big blocks of potatoes - hand cut in rectangles - which had been boiled and baked and fried into a state of blandness that I would never expect from a Gordon Ramsay product.  They were hard at the ends, like they had been overdone.  They were not seasoned at all - no salt when they were removed from the deep fryer - and no flavor at all.  However, the mushy peas were outstanding!!!  I have never really liked mushy peas - I mean, really, who would like anything called mushy peas?  However, this was a combination of whole baby peas and mushy peas with some seasoning that had me eating the entire portion (a first for me.)  In general the bartenders were very helpful and friendly.  Would have been nice had someone checked on our dinner and let us know the status when we went so long without getting our meal, but that's a small point.  I liked the decorations.  It's pretty noisy with music playing but not so much that we couldn't hear each other or talk to the people next to us.  It was pretty busy for 5 PM.  Probably even busier later on.  I would go again, but not for the Fish &amp; Chips - definitely for the Deviled Eggs though.

      We arrived in Vegas on the 22nd. Upon entering the hotel room I immediately noticed a magazine with Gordon Ramsay on the front "Ramsay takes over Vegas" Being a HUGE fan, I read it and got giddy when I found out that not only did Pub &amp; Grill open already, but Burgr was planned to open that very night!! (Turns out it opened earlier in the week, but IT WAS OPEN).    We decided to hit Pub and Grill on Saturday night. Josh was our waiter and I swear he had ESP. Every time we mentioned something we needed POOF there he was with it in hand or said...hey could you use...... I jokingly asked him if the bulldog lamp was wired. Josh was simply amazing. I can't say it enough. I would say he gave us the best service out of all the places we ate at this year. He gets brownie points for remembering my name is Darlene, so many people two minutes later forget and call me Diane, Donna...something with a D.   Ok now for the food. I ordered the Shephard's Pie and my boyfriend ordered the Lamb Burger. The Shephard's Pie was good at first. The mashed potatoes were amazing. However, I quickly discovered I didn't care for lamb, my first time ever trying it. I ate about 1/2 of the dish. I soooo wanted to love it, but just couldn't. My boyfriend loved his lamb burger, said it was in his top 10 of burgers. We ordered dessert, I got the sticky toffee pudding and he got the chocoloate trifle. OH MY GOD!!! The sticky toffee pudding was to die for. I could eat that everyday!! The warm sauce topping the cake with a side of frozen cream was just fantastic. I tried my boyfriend's chocolate trifle and it too was incredible. Layers of chocolate with a brownie on the bottom and served with two little chocolate cookies was very cute.   Pub &amp; Grill is not your typical Pub &amp; Grill.......Gordon Ramsay does it again!!

      An excellent Xmas day dinner!  This was upscale British pub food done really, really well.  I am already looking forward to the next visit.   We chose to eat at the bar since a couple of basketball games were on.  That way we could also ask the bartender about their beer selection.  Our bartender let us sample a few and we ended up going with a pints of Innis &amp; Gunn and Moa.  Those were $8.75 each but so was Pacifico and Corona so no point in going for stuff you can get anywhere else.     The first entree was the "Dublin Brisket" which was set in a pumpernickel bread bowl.  The bowl was filled with hearty tender chunks of beef, cheese and sauerkraut that went well with the side of thousand island.  3 standard steak fries=1 fry here so you only get 4 of them which was enough.    My wife wanted the "Shepard's Pie" and just hearing those two words gave me flashbacks of terrible school cafeteria mush, a poor man's English lasagna if you will.  But this was galaxies away from what I had in the past.  Savory was the word from the first bite.  Each spoonful filled with buttery mashed potatoes, carrots, peas and slow cooked beef and lamb.  A truly awesome dish that I would gladly have any cold weather day.    We skipped all the good looking appetizers and small plates just to make it to dessert.  Everyone recommended the "Sticky Toffee Pudding" so that's what we had and it did not disappoint.  The perfect ending indeed.

      We tried the Hell's kitchen burger. It was not that good. I was expecting more flavor.  Fries were too garlicky. Service was fast and they made sure we always have full glass drink.

      As a Brit I was embarrassed to eat here.. It was terrible. Overpriced ($10 for a side of chips/ potatoes) food not freshly prepared dry and not very warm snapper, mussels and clams old and cold. Very disappointing everything Gordon Ramsey tells establishments not to do. a wine lst that belongs in a 5 star  restaurant not a bar.  And I wish he would stop using the British flag he is not representing the average Brit.

      After a series of meals designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator palette, I was glad to have some flavor-packed comfort food.  At the Pub, we were greeted with warm, soft pretzels acompanied by whipped butter and cheddar spreads. Beef cheeks were tender and tasty. I normally dislike cooked carrots, but these were prepared well and maintained their snappiness. Shepherd's pie was the standout with shredded, braised lamb rather than the usual ground preparation.   After watching Gordon's "Nightmare" shows, it was good to hear he practices what he preaches - each staff member has tasted the dishes they serve, and could describe them well. Our server was also knowledgeable about the Belgian and UK beers.   I was even glad to hear disagreement on favorites - it was good confirmation they were sharing their opinion rather than promoting a certain "chef signature item." To this end, we decided to complete our meal with a blueberry cobbler topped with peanut butter crumble and peanut butter creme fraiche instead of the more traditional sticky toffee pudding.  We'll be back.

      Slow is key word! Not a little bit Terribly slow! 30-45 min for appetizers and the same for the entree! Fish was fishy and small in portion! Appetizer little burger bites were good. Others in my party were not impressed.   Service people are very nice and personable but the kitchen is a disaster and killer!! For $50 a head plus tip I won't go again! Server was embarrassed by the kitchen. The beer is good and the server was knowledgeable. Even on reflection weeks later - No stars for kitchen -wait time and food (fish) poor! Server 4.0. Overall 1 stars. December 26. Unfortunately the service cannot overcome the food since that's why I came.  I would caution accepting high reviews on face value. Appears they must have had a stellar opening and served drinks because the good reviews rarely focused on the Dinner food but liked the bar. Guess it depends on if you are there to eat or drink!  Overall, I left my short trip to Vegas feeling I had wasted one good meal opportunity given the price there are just too many other outstanding choices to waste a dollar or precious time here! Appears Mr. Ramsey is better that hyping his restaurant and TV shows than producing it in his restaurant. Save your time and money.

      I saw this place while exploring the casino and realized that it just opened earlier this month. I decided to take my sister here for a belated Christmas gift (she, like many others, is a Gordan Ramsey fan and aspires to also cook amazing food one day). Luckily, there was no need to physically stand in line - we placed our name on the waitlist and roamed around until the estimated time that that gave us to return, by which they had our table ready.  After we sat down, we had to wait several minutes before the server came to us, but the staff and food more than made up for it. Our waitress, Elyse, was very sociable when she arrived, chatting with us for a while before taking our order. Because of our time constraint, my sister decided to settle for dessert only. We were debating between the sticky toffee pudding and potted triple chocolate trifle (both $9-10) and Elyse highly recommended the sticky toffee pudding, so we decided to go with that. Not disappointed with the overall selection at all!  Sticky Toffee Pudding: The combination of toffee "pudding" (it's actually a cake in Britain) with toffee syrup (wasn't too sweet, which balances out the cake), and vanilla bean ice cream (made fresh daily and gives a nice balance between hot and cold) is heavenly!  Overall: Con: Not getting the waiter right away when we sat down Pro: Not needing to physically wait in line, friendly staff, quality dessert  Will come here next time (over buffets) to try the rest of the menu!

      Being a big fan of Gordon Ramsey and his steakhouse, I had high hopes for this place. My wife and I ate there on Christmas Eve.  Very disappointed. We sat on the pub side and we were not even offered to look at the pub menu. It wasn't until we ordered that I realized there was a second menu. We both chose the fish and chips. Greasy thick batter on flavorless fish. Chips were these thick cut and I don't mean steak like fries, I mean these block rectangular potatoes with no seasoning.  If you want fish and chips go to his steakhouse at Paris!!!  Also, the place just opened and Vegas was packed but this place was half empty at 9 pm.  Lousy vibe and music. The only positive were the cocktails.  Much better choices in Vegas.

      I'm a local Las Vegas resident who had friends visiting and brought them here for dinner. Great atmosphere and food was very good. It took a little longer than expected for our food to arrive but one of the managers, Jason, offered us each a beer for our patience. We declined but it was a very nice gesture from a very attentive manager who checked in with us throughout our meal. Food was worth the price and this will definitely be a regular spot for me and my friends

      Were do I start let's start with the service. It could not have been better. We sat at the bar and Adam took care of us. We had a great time with Adam who guided us through an awesome dining experience. If you go to the bar ask for Adam. However there is one problem virtually all the bar tenders are named Adam. But no worries it seems they are all above average. Ok now the important part the food. It having Ramsey's name carries high expectations. I am happy to say they were meet. I need to particularly point out the Shepherd's Pie. This is something I would normally avoid because of my stepfather's failed attempts. His was the worst thing I ever ate. Gordon's was the best thing I have ever had.  I will be back again and again. Finally a famous chief opens a very approachable place and blows away expectations. Good Job!!!

      I am a huge fan of Gordon Ramsey. I have to say this was a very disappointing experience. Food was mediocre. Service was not great.  Not at all what I would expect from Gordon. One word to sum it up would be OVERRATED!!!

      Gordon Ramsey is blowing up Las Vegas with his steakhouse in Paris, his Pub in Caesars and then his Burgr joint in PH...someone forgot to spell check that sh*t!   Anyhoo, back to pub-tastic...we attended the preview dining and we were very pleased. All the servers were very attentive and pleasant &amp; they have the cutest outfits!  The food was good, a very nice mix of European/English flair, although not a lot of selections for Vegetarians. They have a nice ambiance for a Pub and I would suggest it for sure, it's a mix between a restaurant, bar &amp; lounge - you can choose to sit in any.... EXCEPT.....it's VERY pricey.  Our meal, two people, was $125 :/ Eesh!  My husband had the Scottish beer and he loved it!  "The pub includes 36 beers served on tap plus 24 bottled beers. With an eye towards dishes that pair well with beer the pub menu includes English ale onion soup, shepherd's pie, and a selection of sausages, fried egg sandwiches and the classic pub fish and chips."  Save up your money before you go &amp; Enjoy!!

      I wish I could write a Awesome review but the experience was Terrible. 1/2/13 We had 6:15pm reservations, arrived early and seated at 6:09, from that point it was all down hill off a cliff!  At 6:18 I had to ask one of the 5 waiters/waitresses that had walked by without even looking at us, I had to ask if one of them could help us, and/or who was the server at our table.  We found out that 'Jennifer' was over our table and never did show up and at 6:25pm when 'Kimberly' was assigned to us she comes over apologizes to us, turns to the table beside us to take their order who was just seated, the couple points out that we had been waiting forever and the waitress Kimberly says to her 'it"s ok, I will get them in a minute!'  My wife bless her heart is not one to make a scene stands up with me and I tell the waitress we are leaving for good. Out the door we went, we will not be back, period.  I am a Hugh Gordon Ramsay fan, books, cookware, knives, we have been to dinner at Gordon Ramsay Steak in Vegas, which was excellent. Just for the Gordonites in the crowd.  We left went over to Bobby Flays 'Mesa Grill', was seated in less than 2 minutes, waitress acknowledgement and glass of water on the table in less than 1 minute! Hugh difference, not even close!  Amazing Food and Amazing Service from Mesa Grill!! Saved our evening.  I realize that no may care of even read this review but, it was extremely upsetting to see such a bad performance by the staff of a World Class Chef who I highly admire. The menu is extremely pricy for a pub so save your dollars up and forget the pennies it is not enough!

      Met up with a couple of friends to grab a quick dinner.  Just a note - we looked on the Caesar's website in detail at all of their restaurants to find one that wasn't too overpriced since we had a big weekend of eating at nice places in front of us.  I didn't even know Gordon Ramsay had a place in Caesar's, but to my delight, there it was on the list and it had two $$ in front of it, noting it as an average check price of $20 per person.  This was not the case.  An average cost for an entree appears to be about $28.  So I met up with my friends and ordered a dirty martini, which came out perfect.  We ordered our food and started chatting.  We noticed that 30 minutes had gone by and the waiter had not come back and our food had not arrived.  We waved him down and he said he would go check on it.  10 minutes later the food finally came out.  I had ordered the duck confit salad from the appetizer section.  The portion was almost an entree portion, but half the price!  It was delicious and perfectly cooked.  I finished the entire plate and was just full enough.  One of my friends ordered the roasted chicken, which looked like a tiny whole roasted chicken.  I didn't try any of it but he said it was great.  My other friend ordered the flank steak medium, and it came out medium rare.  She also said it was quite delicious.  We ordered the fingerling potatoes as a side, and those were BOMBtastic.  To my surprise, the side of brussel sprouts were okay (i HATE brussel sprouts).  The ambiance was classy, but not stuffy.  I liked it a lot.  It was fun and just the right amount of loud.  The service was fine, other than the food taking forever, but maybe that's just because it's so new they are still trying to work out all the kinks.  It's also a huge plus my duck confit was only $16 and was such a big portion.  I'd go here again and try the fish and chips.  I saw a couple of waiters carrying that by for another table and my mouth began to water.  They looked phenomenal!

      I'm surprised... Never been to a snobby english prick restaurant before, but there's a first time for everything.  For perspective, our res was New Year's Day.  Waitress was personable, attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu (coincidentally she LOVED all the expensive stuff on the menu, I guess it is Vegas...).  Aside from the weird, tight, newspaper looking dresses that Gordon frocked them in, the waitstaff seemed on the ball as a whole.    Not sure what was going on in the kitchen though, it took a bit over an hour for our food.  If you haven't seen the menu its a trendy gastropub fare with flashes of England throughout.  I got the Lamb T-bone and it was so damn salty my foot swelled almost immediately.  For some reason, all four of our meals seemed a bit salty to me, I guess it is pretty typical english fare but I was a bit disappointed.  The atmosphere was awash with loud english flair accented by the waitstaff's overly loud garb.    Gordon, I just expected more from you.  If you're gonna make a fish and chips joint, be sure to keep it simple and rely on the pure flavor of the food not overseasoning as compensation.

      I was so disappointed. . . I love Gordon and am a Huge fan of his shows, books, cooking, and yes, was so looking forward to his pub here in Vegas.. But in the form of his words it was pure " S.H.I.T." I am not sorry.. but it was  nothing but just that. Short with the Food and horrible service.. It's like a crowd of ducks quaking and not knowing what to do.  .  . Even the Mater D was horrifying.  The fish was uncooked and over cooked for my Fish and chips. The Potatoes were so thick it's hardly a Chip! RIDICULOUS OVER PRICED NASTINESS!  GORDON WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!!!! This joint needs help~ Seriously Real HELP!  I also, hope you can choose a better outfit for your waitresses ... They are horrifying!!  OH BLAH!!! Maybe i'll be back in 6 months once they have worked out all their Kinks but I will not be having the Fish and chips again... So... Sad... So Heart broken...

      In true Las Vegas fashion, my family did Christmas on the Strip starting with dinner at one of the most recent additions to Ramsay's restaurant empire. The good impressions started even before we entered the place. In the first moments of walking up to the restaurant, I fell in love with their uniforms! The hostess' are outfitted in the most adorably sexy newspaper dress accessorized with fingerless leather gloves and matching booties. Someone remind me to ask our loving David S. to steal one for me ;) The uniforms only got better as the rest of the FOH people were dressed in this awesome British punk street wear. Designer Allison Leach of Mad Men and Glee did one heck of a job of creating that awesome first impression.   Our server was a little too high energy for me. You know when you have that fake salesperson vibe when they're trying to sell you something? Yeah, it was a little much. But other then that our server and serving assistants were working like a well-oiled machine. My mother is a lightweight and needed a girly beer. Our server smartly suggested the strawberry Fruli... It is now her favorite beer ever. And bread service was amazing. It shows up warm and delicious with a cheddar cheese spread and whipped butter cream. Andthey don't have a problem with serving you seconds. Hands down the best bread basket in town.    The food. Oh man, the food is British pub action on point. I was itching to try some Sheperd's Pie. And although it is one of the cheapest entrée items it was one of the most delicious non-Asian foods I've eaten in forever. Tender chunks of lamb, beef, and vegetables blanketed in mouth-watering mashed potatoes. *heaven* In the fish &amp; chips, they used cod which was a little heavier on the breading but fried to perfection. And the chips (fries) were thick blocks of fried potato served piping hot. Instead of a salad, we ordered a side of Brussels sprouts sautéed with bacon and apples. The slices of apple were real treats! They absorbed all the delicious flavors from the seasoning  and the sugar cooked off in the little bit of bacon fat. Amazing! I wish there were more than just 2!   The only downside to our meal was the lamb riblettes appetizer. Tiny bits of lamb were served with a creamy cumin-based yogurt sauce. It was tasty but for the price, portion size was absolutely abysmal. GR insider David S. says the lamb entrée is the way to go and 1000x better.   I'm loving GR's new diggs. It's cool but still upscale with the food &amp; service to match. I shall return.   Cheers!

      We went for lunch yesterday...service is solid, food is good, but...  Portions - smallest of any restaurant in Vegas. Seriously? For a pub? Micro sized burgers, and my wife's Mac &amp; Cheese, while good, was the size of an average side at Del Frisco's. I had the Reuben, which was creatively done, but for the same price I can go to Carnegie at the Mirage and get a monster sandwich (with the same quality of ingredients). The woman next to us had fish &amp; chips, which was so small she went to the food court afterwards.  Seating - they said they were full, even though 1/3rd of the tables were empty; which the hostess said were all reserved. So we ate at the bar. After an hour and a half (we linger a bit over lunch), on our way out we noticed pretty much all the same tables were still empty. So either the hostesses are holding things up to get tipped, or the casino is demanding an awful lot of held tables. Either way, Gordon, you are leaving a LOT of money on all those empty tables.

      This was one of the worst restaurants ever. The food was great and juicy but the portions of the food was bad. We ordered the lamb ribs and they only gave us 2 tiny ribs the size of our pinky. Then we ordered this other dish that had steak, shrimp and ribs for $44.00 but they only gave us 1 shrimp, 1 riblet the size of my little pinky, and a tiny piece of steak. What a rip off if you guys haven't eat here yet don't they charge you a lot of money for just little portions of food.

      Hmmmmmm, not quite sure where to start. Small portions, high prices, and then undercooked food. My food had to go back twice, first they cooked the burger wrong, and then the french fries were undercooked. This place is horribly understaffed. it took an act of congress just to get my drink refilled. This place needs some serious help before I will even think of going back again.   2 people, 2 burgers, and 2 glasses of ice tea = $52.98!!!  WOW!!!!  no appetizers or dessert.  I'm a little shocked and disappointed considering who owns this place.

      Went in around 4PM on a Thurs. Had a limited menu to pick from since dinner menu starts @5. Staff seemed very friendly. Then I realized my beer was not what I ordered. Next some appetizers did not arrive. Waiter seemed to disappear.  After several apologies, we get our food 45 minutes after sitting down. The food was good, but definitely not great. Also, though I usually prefer smaller portions, these portions we really small. Not good value.  Do yourself a favor and go to Mesa Grill instead.

      Came for dinner opening week.  No reservation, pretty easy to get a table.  This is an attractive restaurant, I really enjoyed the decor and uniforms.  Service was also pretty good aside from the one major issue of the night, menus (minus 1 star).  There were 4 people in our party and we had three menus showing one price and one menu that was about $10 higher per entree.  It is a big difference if the Shepard's pie is $25 or $16.  We asked about the price difference and the server immediately took away the expensive menu, but it makes me wonder...  The food was all great.  Portion sizes were average for the Shepard's pie, large for the pork chop, and VERY tiny for the lamb riblettes appetizer.   Beer selection was great including a dry English cider.  Sticky toffee pudding was very good served in a traditional fashion with plenty of sauce.   Value was reasonable for Vegas standards using the prices on the cheaper menu.  I will happily return as long as the expensive menu prices don't take effect.

      First - the food is exceptional. The problem is with the front-of-house and overall presentation. Arrived 6pm and the place was 75% empty. Seating only by reservation! We had to cool our heels 15 minutes because they do not accept walk up business! I suppose this keeps out the riff-raff but it also keeps out customers. The bimbo squad that act as greeters/seaters are just that - bimbos. Fairly attractive and none too smart or just not well trained. Or both. The drink menu is presented to you on an iPad but the size of drink involved and the pricing does not match what they offer you! Attempted an $8.75 25oz. Newcastle draft off the iPad but could only order a pint at $7.75! Pints were not even on the iPad menu! They mention that this is a 'craft' beer place but it must be relegated to the bottled section as the draft selection is pretty pedestrian. Did I mention the food is outstanding? No doubt, this is what kept this at a 4-star rating. But they serve the entrees in a plate that is almost like a bowl. This makes cutting meat a bit of a challenge. The 2-seat tables are pretty small with little room to manage all the glasses, bread plates, raised wooded placemats, etc AND the freaking iPad. Service was decent by the wait staff. The decor does not match the hype. It is pretty boring and almost ugly unless half-kegs of beer as wall art is your thing. From place settings to 'reservation only' seating this is as far from a friendly, down-to-earth pub as one can imagine. I suspect Gordon Ramsay was involved in the menu and the overall licensing of his name/image and that is about it as part of his overall Harrah's deal. This location in Caesar's was Bradley Ogden's which was an overall brilliant restaurant across the board. Too bad it was replaced with this - which boasts as friendly and inviting but really isn't. But this is all about the food and the food is OUTSTANDING. Just don't expect a Michelin experience.

      Me and my lady went there for dinner on New Years Eve and found it to be to our liking! The staff was helpful and friendly. We split a short rib (&amp; cheek) sandwich, a beet salad, and a pint of New Castle on tap. It's loud because it's open and faces the Forum Casino at Caesars Palace. It's a fun place and I can't wait to go back!

      Good as far as pub food goes and very knowledgeable barkeeps.  You might be waiting a while for a table, but I can see why.
