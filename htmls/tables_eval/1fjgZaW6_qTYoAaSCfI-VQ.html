      This hotel is surpisingly nice and new, but far from the strip (10 minute drive).  Other than location, I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel for familes as there is a bowling alley, an arcade, and a decent pool.  The room is very clean and bigger than average.  Bathroom is decent, and beds as well.  I want to note that they have a really good blackjack game.  Here the dealer does not automatically win if he/she has blackjack.  Instead players are able to play their hands normally and if you happen to reach 21, you can tie the dealer's 21 and still push!  If you're playing optimal strat, you'll be very, very close to 50/50 odds on this game!

      Usually I equate bargain hotels in Vegas with something just above a trailer park in quality (example: Circus Circus)  But this is by far and away the best bargain hotel I've stayed at in Vegas. It cost only about $300 to stay for five days the week of July fourth. I was expecting to pay WAY more than that for that week.  The place is very new so the rooms look great with no problems.   The casino games here are cheaper than on the main part of the strip. For instance, they have plenty of $5 blackjack tables which are a rare find on most of the strip.  However, the food here lacks something to be desired. The buffet is about half the price of Rio buffet and is at least half the quality of Rio as well.  Overall, a great find for anyone on a budget in Vegas.

      We were surprised at how nice this hotel was. It's far and off the strip, but it's new and clean. The casino area was sooooooo bright that even at 10pm when you walked inside, you feel like it was daytime. I'm actually considering staying here the next time we come, but like I said, I'm considering it.  They have a kids daycare center just like at The Orleans so it would definitely make things very easy if we wanted to go play in the casino for a while without lil guy. However the down side to staying here would be that it is definitely very far from the strip and if you don't have a car, that would totally suck.

      This is one of my favorite hotels... the rooms are priced for the average Joe who doesn't want to spend 3 to 4 hundred a night but still would like to enjoy a nice room and a nice place to gamble.  The gambling limits are pretty low here.  Fun for people who want to gamble for entertainment... and maybe come up a little.  I highly recommend this place!

      Nice, new resort which is a drive from the strip. Seemed to be more family-oriented, with movie theaters, bowling alley, etc., and lots of kids around. Although I didn't gamble there, the casino floor is huge. We did stop for a bite at their seafood cafe, and the food and service were ok. We didn't stay at the hotel. I suppose if you don't mind being far from the action of the strip; and assuming room rates are less here because it's not centrally located, this place is probably a good deal for a family trip. It has quite a few things for the kids to keep busy while mom and pops gamble away their life savings.

      The ventilation in the casino is poor, and the whole place reeks of cigarette smoke. I was worried that our non smoking floor would have the same issue, but the air was fresh and clean smelling there - as was our room.   Our room was extremely spacious and well furnished. The bed was very comfortable, and the TV was a flat screen. The TV channels left something to be desired, however. There must have been about 5 channels that were solely of horse racing.......  You can hear the AC throughout the night if you leave it on.  The walls were not thin - I couldnt really hear anything in the hallway, unless someone slammed a door, which only happened once.  There is an issue with the housekeeping - They knocked twice in one day to confirm that the room was clean. On one hand, I like that they would make sure that the room is clean. On the other, I would expect them to keep track of that.   The hotel is new, so you can sleep better knowing that there havent been many who have slept in your bed. I also liked that the things in their gift shop, like bottles of water or toothbrushes were not marked up as drastically as they were in hotels on the strip.   A great room at a great price. Definetely Worth a stay. Theres a movie theater and a bowling alley here too.

      The hotel rooms are very clean and extremely spacious. You have a flat screen tv and huge bathroom. If this place was located on the Strip, I'd give it 5 stars. But alas, it is about 10 mins from the Strip, which is probably why it can afford to build bigger rooms.   There's a free shuttle that runs from the airport to the hotel and back. There's also a free shuttle that takes you to/from the Strip, but stops pretty early in the evening. Call to put your name on the list if you wanna take the shuttles. I say stay here if you are driving into Vegas and can drive yourself to the Strip. Stay on the Strip if you are flying in cuz you either gotta work w/the shuttle times or spend quite a lot on cab fare.   Very nice gym with new equipment, tv's on every machine, complete set of weights and machines.

      South Point is a hotel/casino geared towards locals in the Las Vegas/Henderson area. It has an equestrian center, Bowling, Bingo, Movies and Night life.   The staff was very efficient and got us in very quickly. Everyone was friendly and they give you a nice little coupon book for you to use on your stay. We booked on Vegas.com and it was $50 less than any other website, including their own.  We were there on the weekday and some tables were $1 minimums which is nice when you are starting to learn to play. The dealers were very patient and taught me some games.  We even played Bingo and that was fun too.  Now, the rooms.... I thought they were very nice King Deluxe rooms with super comfy beds that had cotton linens, not that tacky polyester. We requested non smoking on a high floor and thats what we got.  They had a great 42-inch plasma televisions. The prices for room service and in room movies was your typical rates ($13 movies/ $25 with tip for Dinner). We ordered Chinese food to our room (Kung Poa Shrimp-really spicy-yum) and its was very delish.   Our room had plenty of square footage and a nice little love seat. The bathroom was very clean, with a seperate grooming area (mirror/sink) from the actual shower/toilet which is nice.  We ended our stay with a 3am breakfast at Coronado Cafe. It didn't disappoint and neither did the prices.   The only thing we didn't get to enjoy was the pool. boo. it was being renovated.   Overall we had a really great time and I would 100% Stay here again.

      Cheap, brand new and great rooms. Very luxurious and updated at a great price. The location is slightly off the strip but I can't see how the strip wouldn't be expanding and place this hotel in a  prime spot in like 5 years from now.  I highly recommend it to all.

      I was doing my best to stretch out my dollar for as long as I could playing at the penny slots. My cheap ass was waiting to get a cocktail waitress to walk by and offer to get me a drink. Fifteen minutes after I had played my dollar, one finally came in the area but she was hauling ass and didn't slow down to see me. It was alright here. At least I saw something mildly amusing - an ankle bracelet/tracking device on one of the waitresses. Random!

      Poker Room Review:  Playing poker here is harsh.  First, it's not even a room.  It's more like semi-closed off area in the back of the casino.  There's way too much open space and not enough cocktail waitresses or TVs.  The mise en scene of the room throws me off.  Worst of all, I didn't get the cards I needed to play.  A two seven off-suit can only take me so far.  The thing is my boys seem to win here, so what's a guy to do?  Have you ever taken one for the team? If you have, you know what I'm talking about. If you haven't, stand firm and weigh your options. http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=take+one+for+the+team  But no worries since I can go to Big Sur Oyster Bar while they play. http://www.yelp.com/biz/big-sur-oyster-bar-las-vegas#hrid:tcssVi14UormweX233SlQw

      This is the only Las Vegas we know of that has the penny slot Star Wars machine.  They also have an old skool arcade (man of the machines will eat your quarters), and a huge bowling alley that's so nice that they actually hold tournaments there.  The buffet and restaurants aren't that great, but the ice cream cafe is really good (their one scoop looks like a 2 scoops!).  Had a drink at the casino bar before and wasn't impressed.  Stayed in a room when they first opened up and it was nice, but this time around the place smelled just like any other casino - smoky.  Will try the Bingo game upstairs next time - it looked intense with tons of people in a large room.  Another nice aspect - its off the Strip.  If you want something a little more mellow, and where the locals hang out - this place will suffice.

      I've stayed at Ballegio and the Shara, and this is the best hotel in Las Vegas in terms of price vs. quality. The rooms are cheap and clean with a ton of amenities such as a flat screen TV and Dow comforter.   The hotel itself has tons of stuff to do if your not a gambling type. There is a pool, bowling alley, and movie theater. All are within walking distance from the room. The hotel also gives you a coupon book that can be used throughout the hotel. I definitely recommend using the Garden Buffet 2 for 1 lunch coupon. I used it for four people and end up paying only 4 dollars per person for a great buffet place.   The only bad things about this place is that its about 15 mins from the strip and there is no free Internet. Other then those two things I would definitely recommend coming here.  Price vs. Quality: 5 stars Room Cleanliness: 5 stars Service: 4 stars - checkout lines was pretty long Amenities: 5 stars

      I haven't personally stayed at this location, I always get a timeshare at the Grandview.  But I have to say that the South Point is part of the reason I like staying at the Grandview.  It's like being in Vegas without having to walk through the smokey casino to get to my room.  I like being able to just cross the street to get a good buffet, bowl a game then watch a late night movie.  I even got to watch the opening midnight showing of Sex in the City here.  It was a blast!

      South Point is a really good hotel for an inexpensive price if you don't mind staying south of the strip. You can't miss it while driving by on the 15-- South Point's golden windows can hurt the eye when the sun is out in full force. The rooms are really spacious and have big flat screen TVs. They provide Bath &amp; Body Works toiletries, which is nice. After the first night I noticed I had a bug bite on my side. Not cool. We ate at only one (Coronado Cafe) of their 7 restaurants, and it was pretty average. They also have an oyster bar, which I haven't seen in Vegas before (but then again, I'm not a regular).   3 star hotel, but an extra star because they have a 64 lane bowling alley which was AWESOME!

      I checked in my 3 managers and myself for a 3 day conference and upon getting too my suite, decided it was too plain and checked out.  I had a good $135 rate on the Professional suite, but it was too plain and spacious.  I went over to the Bellagio and got a room for $142 and commuted the few times I needed to be there.  If you get a regular room for about $50 it is a pretty good deal though and spacious.

      I stayed here for 2 nights and I enjoyed every moment here, except making my donation to the tables the first night.  The rooms are VERY comfortable, the most comfortable I have ever been in Las Vegas.  So comfortable, I slept early on the second night at 11:30 pm and woke up fresh the next morning.  Never have I slept so great in Las Vegas!    $1 Rilouete, but no electronic scoreboard, it's okay, very fun.    South Point is nice if you don't mind the 5 minute drive to the strip, but on the upside, it's very relaxing and very close to the new town center.

      This hotel is like the BEST in terms of value and quality of your stay.  The hotel is further off the strip than the majority of the hotels in Vegas but the distance is very much worth the amenities.   You have a spacious, clean and new room.  They've got flat screens, the MOST COMFORTABLE BEDS! ever, and coconut lime scented bath and body works products.  I played a little in the casino which didn't really stand out to me.  I ate at the cafe which was eh, nothing outstanding.  In all, the goal of this trip was to be a little low key, gambling and relaxing.  South Point definitely helped us meet our goal.  Thanks!

      So where do you go when you really want to go to Vegas and it happens to be on a weekend or a holiday and the rates are ridiculous on the strip? You go here, I've stayed here numerous times now and have always had a pleasant experience. You must, must rent a car if staying here anything else will not due. They have a shuttle supposedly but I've never seen it, this place is about 10 mins from Vegas' main drag. Anyway the rooms are very nice, flat screen TV's and very comfy beds. I like that they have a lot of entertainment under one roof, a huge bingo hall, a bowling alley and movie theater. Late night bowling is super cheap too and you're ok if you forget socks cause the vending machine sells them. I also like that they have a liquor store on site with very reasonable prices. The coffee shop restaurant also has some dirt cheap late night specials for like $2 to $3, very filling. A recent discovery there were the buffalo wings with the hot sauce, it was so good I even asked for an additional side. If you get on their email list you will get some awesome room prices, $50 for weekdays, $100 for weekends. They also have a spa but have not tried it yet. As for gambling, which I do just a little of, the tables and machines are not that great. But they do have $5 tables which makes it reasonable for a low roller like me. My game of choice here is Bingo, they have a huge hall and tons of old folks to make it an enjoyable time. Definitely recommend it.

      $5 black jack Proximity Christmas Eve/Day  Visiting my family in Vegas, never leave an opportunity to gamble a little bit of the hard earned money. Not a high roller unless you call 200 bucks over three days, free spending.  In most of these sessions, I go up , I go down and wind up 4 hours of interesting fun.  For example, last night, Everybody was winding down at home, its raining, I am bored.  I decide I will try to go do a little gambling and since the weather is rainy and the roads slick, I decide to stick close to home.  Southpoint Casino is only a 10 minute drive from my parents so it was the obvious choice.  In times and days like these, you are not expecting holly jolly gamblers, mostly locals, visitors and bored people like me. 4  1/2 hours later, I leave with 27 dollars ahead and lots of bottled water ( Remember Kids Don't Drink and Drive)  I would say the lower limit all night was very good for my budget but unlike most casinos I go to in Vegas.  The shift of the dealers seem to be a different one each time as opposed to those just going on break and coming back.  It's always more fun to gamble your money away with a fun group and an interactive dealer.  Last night's dearler ran the gamut. Nice lady dealer- interactive 2 back to back Talkative African American dealer - fun 3 Consecutive dealers with various styles of dealling from one dealer who is too serious, to another who deals the card so fast, your chips disappear before you know it.  I think we were dealt the most of 6 decks in 2 min.    After realizing I had not lost any money, I looked at my watch and discovered it was 5 am Christmas morning and I am in a second rate casino away from the strip.  Sidenote, I guess they do cheap drinks in this casino and due to the fact that drinks were only a dollar from Christmas Eve to 8 am Christmas Morning, At least half a dozen fights broke away from the gaming tables.  Merry Christma and Happy Holiday to you too!!  P.S.  The hotel is decently priced away from the strip and was only buile several years ago. Kid friendly with a bowling alley and movie theaters in the premises.

      To conclude my Las Vegas anthology, I had drinks at the SouthPoint Casino my final night in Vegas. SouthPoint is one of the larger local Casinos, that are tend to populate the off strip areas of Vegas.   Why SouthPoint? They had some kind of dollar drink promotion. Dollar mixed drinks, and dollar "shots". There was a mixed crowd, mostly younger locals, with a dash of a few older folks with eye patches.   Truth be told, these dollar drink bargains were poured a bit weak, and the "shots" were maybe half shot sized. Well at least it was cheap. Interesting vibe, interesting locals. A good time was had.

      Negative: I had a steak meal here which made me sick for an entire week. Hell I was pissed.    Positives : Great Hotel Rooms (very comfy) and not so expensive. There's flat screen TVs which you don't find in every hotel. Graveyard bowling at 1 dollar a game (if I remember correctly) rocked. Pure awesomeness.   (I can't help giving a 1 rating on this despite the positives)

      In retrospect, I should've stayed here instead of the Luxor aka "SUCKSor".  The hotel is virtually brand new and everything is pretty nice.  My parents, aunt AND grandma all got rooms for $49 a night.  TIP:  Even though this place is about 10 mins from the strip,  its worth it.  The hotel is very modern and all the money you save on the room, can be spent on cab rides back and forth to the strip, gambling and whatever else your into.

      Went for Superbowl weekend.  Should have rolled the dice and waited to make reservations, because their price dropped in half the week before.  Yeah, it's a nice budget hotel. WARNING!!!!!!!!!! If you are using a debit/credit card, they will add a refundable $200 deposit fee when you check in. got home yesterday, no word on the 'refund'. Coupon book is cool.  The overall ventilation was fine, except a group sitting next to us in the DelMar lounge for the game must have had BOXES of cigars and had 4-6 going at any one time for a solid 10 hours. GAG!  We ate at the seafood restaurant twice- hubby raved about the oysters and crab legs- both a good price. Other stuff was average.  The cafe has the bestest fluffiest omelette I have had anywhere. Everything else was average. Didn't hit the buffet- we can't eat enough to make it worth it.  I hope they tightened the slots for the weekend and that they don't always suck that bad. Never lost so much so fast- at least let me have some fun before you take it!  Saw comedian John Caparulo on friday night. Great venue- no bad seats. Drinks had alcohol in them, the cranberry mix is gross. Not ridiculously priced considering. I saw other people order shots- LMAO! A dose of nyquil is bigger!!!!!! Seriously. I think they use the same cup.  I can see that the place could be overrun with screaming kids quite quickly- ew.

      How the hell is everything so inexpensive at this casino?!  I waited what felt like forever at the sports book bar for a drink...to the point where I give the bartender shit. "hi 2 coronas, 2 shots of patron...oh and why dont you have like 4 more bartenders working in this packed as bar..bla bla bla" I kind of went off....he apologizes and then gives me my total "$4 please"  whaaa??    yeah, so I don't know the exact happy hour times, but it was like midnight on a Friday!!  Casino is a little hillbilly, but the $1 drinks totally make up for it.  The taqueria is actually pretty good as well.
