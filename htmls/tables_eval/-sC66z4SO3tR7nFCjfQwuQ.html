      I'm excited to be the first REAL review of this place.  We decided to stop by here in favor of Postino, as we have already been multiple times, and boy am I glad we did.  This is like the 4th or 5th, or maybe 12th different restaurant inside the ever-so-lovely Clarendon Hotel.  In what seems to be a revolving door of restaurant concepts in this rather charming space, I think we have finally found a winner.  Gallo Blanco does something that not enough restaurants do.  They downsize their menu drastically to have only a few different options for lunch/dinner, and a few options for breakfast, plus a few assorted appetizers.  I much prefer a restaurant to have a few things on the menu that they perfect rather than a whole bunch of items that are only so-so.  The dinner menu offers a few entrees including steak and chicken and then there are tortas or tacos with your choice of delectable meat stuffed inside.  The husband and I ordered the cheese crisp (not what you think) and the pork sandwiches.  I would give the Spanish names, but I've got nothing for ya.    The cheese crisp was a fantastic giant fried concoction.  It seems like it was a large tortilla, or something, covered in cheese and deep fried wrapped around something round.  It was really good, I can't describe it much better, just get it if you go.  The pork tortas were so delicious.  The pork was tender and flavorful.  it was mixed with some shredded lettuce, a couple slices of fresh avocado, and there was a delightfully tangy/spicy sauce underneath.  The bread was unbelievably tasty, slightly sweet with a perfect texture.  I was excited to actually have a true torta bun instead of your average run of the mill hamburger bun.  We decided to split the chocolate pudding for dessert.  It was served in a small tumbler.  The chocolate pudding wasn't a traditional pudding and was much thinner.  However, it went perfectly with the graham crackers and the truly homemade marshmallow fluff.  The marshmallow stuff was soooooo good and you can taste the quality.  A tasty yet simple dessert.  What a great experience!  I only took away one star because the restaurant was far from busy but the wait for food was a little too long to be deemed acceptable.  However, our server was so sweet and charming, and her English accent was almost unbearably adorable.  It was her first day on the job but she was phenomenal.  I definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone and I hope we finally have a permanent resident in the Clarendon restaurant space.

      I may be a bit too enthusiastic about Gallo Blanco because I've been craving a genuine taqueria with great food and reasonable prices.  Gallo Blanco delivers on both fronts.  The owner was the founding chef at LGO and his attention to quality ingredients shows.  We started with the Chicharron de Queso - sort of a fried cheese crisp - with a terrific aioli dipping sauce.  The Queso wasn't my favorite but my wife loved it.  Things picked up with the vegetable of the day - baked asparagus.  Well seasoned and absolutely delicious.  The highlight for me was the Carne Asada Torta ($6.00), a delicious sandwich with a fried egg on top.  Truly spectacular.  I'll come back for this dish alone but don't let that stop you from trying the rest of the menu. The Vegetarian taco (Verduras de Temporada) was spectacular and at only $2.00, you should order a few to fill up.  We finished our meal with the Postre de Chocolate, a pudding, marshmallow and graham cracker dessert that is to smores what creme boule is to caramel.   We also tried several of GB's drinks.  The Michelada ($5.00) was refreshing and tasty and the Horchata very tasty (and much less sweet than the saccharin types served too often).  I also tried a Vodka Aguas Frescas ($7.00) - in this case, watermelon, not my favorite fruit but still darn tasty.  When I commented that I'd order it again with a bit more lime and alcohol another appeared gratis.  These people care about their customers.  With great food and a great location (how about a cocktail on the rooftop afterward?) Gallo Blanco is a great addition to the CenPho dining scene.

      I had such a wonderful experience at Gallo Blanco.  I really contemplate going back every day as I drive by.  The sangria was pretty good (I prefer red though) and they had a full bar - so you have to love that.  The decor is sweet with a sort of rustic/modern/southwest vibe to it.  The cheese crisp tube thing was wicked good.  Can't say enough about the aioli that came with it.  Little spicy, lots of flavor - the perfect compliment.  As for my meal, the pork torta thing was wicked good.  Seriously, $6 for this?  Could you be any better of a deal?  Actually, writing this review makes me want to go back.  I might just have to tonight.  We had the weird pudding/marshmallow thing for dessert.  It wasn't my favorite dessert but it was really good.  Nothing quite like a s'more in pudding form.  The food did take a little while to come out.  I can forgive it because our waitress was so nice and helpful and because I enjoyed everything that I got.  I really sucks to wait for 15+ minutes for food and then have it suck.  Thankfully, this did not happen here.  Top notch.  Hopefully Clarendon finally has found a permanent tenant in Gallo Blanco.

      I had to update my review to share a very important finding since my first review.  Gallo Blanco has the best guacamole you'll ever taste.  Bet on it.  There's more going on here than you're standard guac but it's still familiar enough to bring to mind all your favorite onion, cilantro, lime and guacamole memories.  Now add orange - or what I think was orange but somehow much, much better than you can possibly imagine.  My continuous improvement suggest for GB is that all guacamole orders come with a privacy screen.  It's just too good not to dive in without abandon, making a complete and utter fool of yourself.  This chef has a deft touch and a very refined sense of balance with flavors.  Do not pass up the guac!

      Really great tacos!  The fish and carne asada tacos taste fresh and delicious, al beit small, but they are only $2 each so order as many as you like!  The chips and quac are perfect!  I love thick crunchy not too greasy but just enough chips and the guac is FRESH, real and as posted has a tint of oranges in there-- so good.  I also had the frijoles and holy moly frijole- they were gooood.  My friend had the elote-con queso and said was was fabulous.  It is a simply clean menu with high quality taste--   I can't wait to plan a get together with friends there and have some drinks and food too!  This trip was food only.   Not to mention the breakfast menu had me craving eggs really bad.  http://www.galloblancocafe.com/

      I wish Yelp would let us give half stars...cause this place would definitely be getting 2.5 stars from me. However, since I don't have that luxury, and since I'm feeling generous, we'll go with 3.   Suffice it to say, I didn't think this place was anywhere NEAR as good as some of my foreyelpers. According to my dinner-mate (who also lives in Phoenix), the restaurant at the Claredon Hotel has had some identity crises in the past...Gallo Blanco is merely the latest manifestation and has only been open a few weeks. The ambiance was pretty good (earning this place one of its stars)...the dimly lit, minimalist-designed dining room with exposed concrete flooring lent itself well to the theme of the restaurant, with great big windows on one end.  Our waitress was an adorable blonde from Manchester, England, who was very sweet and attentive, and the service was fabulous the whole evening...seriously, our food came out in the blink of any eye! I know others have complained that the service was slow, so all I have to say to them is that maybe they stepped up their game in the past few days or something...anyway, it was wicked fast (point for Ms. Manchester and the quick entree-serving, too).   So...here's where lack of stars comes in: the food. We started with the Guacamole, which one yelper claimed was the, "best guacamole you'll ever taste." This is false. It is NOT the best guacamole you'll ever taste. It doesn't even rank in my top 10. I guess I like more traditional guacamole, because this was NOT traditional, and it just didn't really hit the spot for me. It was very chunky and had actual slices of little tangerines (i think) in it. The "hint of orange" was, in my opinion, a drawback. I just...didn't love it. Or even like it that much. I think I make better guac at home. Along with the guac, we also got a tomatillo sauce that was very boring...I've had some excellent tomatillos, and this didn't rank.  For my meal, I ordered the Cochinita Torta, which is basically pork served on a bun with some lettuce and some sort of aoili. I had read good reviews about the pork torta, but was hugely disappointed. First of all, the bun is like...one that you'd buy in the grocery store. NOTHING special about it, which was slightly disappointing. It just didn't have the constitution to really contain or complement the contents of the torta. The torta contents themselves were also nothing to write home about. My biggest complaint was the fact that there wasn't much pork, and the pork that was there wasn't, honestly, all that great. The aoili (which was seriously not much of a step above mayo) totally overpowered the pork and made the sandwich kind of...soggy. A soggy mayo and pork sandwich. That's what I had. It wasn't very good.  I think next time I'd go with the tacos...my friend ordered them and they looked less...disappointing. She appeared to like them pretty well.  The other star that I HAVE to give this place, though, is for the prices...$6.50 for the torta and $4.00 for the 2 tacos. We didn't get any alcohol, so all in all we spent $11 apiece. I may not have liked my food, but at least I didn't spend a fortune on it. The price is the only thing that would entice me to come back and try something else.

      I am a woman that likes lime in her Mexican Beer. I mean, a LOT of lime. Gallo - you scratch me where I itch! They fresh squeeze lime juice and when mixed with your tecate, you are in heaven!  Aside from the best beer in town, they also have amazing fresh squeezed watermelon &amp; lime juice and iced coffee. The best news of all is that the iced coffee is $1.25 and I heard they order from Cartel in Tempe!  I have been to Gallo twice now. The first time I tried the veggie tacos and took a bite of the veggie torta. Both were seriously to die for. Over the weekend I had the huevos rancheros for brunch, and those too were out of this world! They also have a tomatillo sauce that is super good.   Not only is the food and drink amazing, but the prices are awesome too! I had breakfast, iced coffee and two beers for $17.  (I did hear over the weekend that they will be raising their prices soon, which sucks, but I would be fine paying more because the quality certainly justifies it!!)  Even better news, you can get all of this POOL SIDE at the Clarendon pool! Ummm... you really cannot go wrong!  I have no complaints about the service. The menu is small but varied, so as a hotel guest I feel like you could eat there a few times during your trip without feeling worn out of the taste.  I am super stoked that Gallo is now in Clarendon, because I will spend my weekends delighting in that delicious Tecate while I munch on some $2 veggie tacos poolside!

      I had the great opportunity of meeting up for lunch here today around noon and was pleasantly satisfied! Last time I was in this space it had an Asian theme but they've redone it and it looks super. To eat we started off with two iced teas, an order of the guac, two veggie tacos, a veggie torta and I had the ensalada de la casa. Everything was fantastic; the veggie tacos are a steal at two dollars! I could have probably eaten 10-15 of them! The torta was delicious too and had the same marinated seasonal veggie mix between telera bread. My salad was light and refreshing, although it could have been a little larger. Props to all the friendly staff and to our competent server who went out of her way to make sure everything was to our liking. She inquired about our food preferences, told her we were vegetarian, and impressed us by actually understanding what ingredients are veggie friendly. Can't wait to try breakfast and drinks here in the future!

      Four stars for now, this place will almost certainly earn more as I return.  This is now my go-to margarita (particularly for the entirely reasonable $7) and the ($2! TWO!!! DOLLARS!!!) tacos were excellent as well.  I tried one of each taco - they offer steak, pork, fish, and seasonal veggie.  I think I'll go heavy on the steak and fish upon future visits - the pork taco had carmelized pineapple on it and was just a little too sweet for my taste.  The veggie taco was great, but not really my style.    I was afforded a bite of the corn, which was lightly spiced and heavily sprinkled with some deliciously pungent powdery cheese.  I can't wait to get a cob of this for myself.  Very juicy, and flavorful.  I missed a taste of the other appetizer my table ordered - the fried cheese roll thing.  This is an almost airy roll of what must have been a cheese batter - I wonder what one would have to do to get a demonstration of how that thing was made - that looked fairly delicious, from my point of view.  The guac was quite tasty, although I don't know that I would call it the best I've ever experienced.  I enjoyed the salsas that were offered nearly as well.  The chips were a slightly thicker variety, with a great fresh crunch and good flavor of their own.    The service was a bit hectic - our waiter had some help that seemed to come at random times and I wasn't totally sure they were helping him out as much as confusing everyone.  Given that it's a new restaurant, apparently a waiter was out for some reason, and the fact that nothing actually offensive or problematic occurred, I won't dock stars, but I expect this aspect to improve on my next visit.  Perhaps we won't invite 8 people who each expect separate checks next time and it won't be a problem (but what fun would that be?).    The ambiance - I liked the design of the place, although it would be nice if they had a slightly larger TV above the bar, and the layout is a little.... interesting, with the bar area right near the lobby and all.  The main seating area looked like a more compelling place to enjoy a leisurely meal, with large windows, some bench seating along the wall, and a better division of space.    All told, I really enjoyed my experience here, both food-wise and every entertaining second of the conversation.  I'm excited to return again and again (the corn, dessert, a torta, the cheese appetizer, perhaps breakfast?) I can hardly wait, in fact.

      I am going to hold back a star because I didn't get to take pictures off the rooftop.  A private party, with really obnoxious karaoke  singers, had booked the rooftop lounge.  I was there for PFN and had drug my neighbor, Cindy Y., along.  I chose Hefeweizen and she was drinking the regular margaritas. To eat I had one each: pork taco, fish taco and carne asada taco.  All were good.  I thought the carne asada taco had more of a of a pineapple taste than I was expecting.  Cindy had a pork taco, fish taco and grilled corn on the cob which comes with parmesan and some other stuff on it.  Nathan S. who sat with us to eat had a pork torta that he was quite pleased with.  We both enjoyed everything and the prices were quite reasonable.   In addition to the traditional restaurant and bar areas you can choose to sit out by the pool which is a large enough area to accommodate a couple of reasonable sized groups at the same time and still allow for mingling.  I would suggest maybe doubling the number of chairs and tables though.  They have a server assigned to the pool area or you can go inside to order.  For a restaurant to make it in a small hotel in Arizona they have to have enough draw to bring local folks in during those months that are slow in the hotel business.  So far these folks seem to be off to a good start.  I took my shop car rather than get to yet another downtown venue where parking my truck would be a hassle.  I needn't have worried, there was plenty of easy access parking in the lot and on the street.

      Wow! I know it's been a minute since I've been on here, so you know it's gotta be something good, right??!!!  I went to Gallo and was COMPLETELY blown away with how great everything was! From service to food to prices( wow the prices!)  I got the Cheesburger, Carne Asada Beef Torta, and the Cochinita(pork) and fish tacos and loved each flavor of everything! The pork had a sweet bbq flavor which was a nice surprise, the french fries were  salty just like I love em, the burger was juicy and flavorfull, and the Carne was seasoned great and used a perfect amount of cilantro ( how I luv cilantro!!)!  I especially loved that the whole meal, which I shared ( I didn't eat all that people! LOL!), was only $22!!! That's cheaper than a Taco Bell or Armandos run!!  Needless to say I was craving it again last night after I tried it in the morning, but didn't go back, only giving myself one cheat meal! HA HA!!  But I'll be back, A LOT!!!

      A missed opportunity ....   I was excited that the LGO heritage was going to invade my 'hood (again)... BIG MISTAKE... tonight was a disappointment .... I encouraged my friends to join me at Gallo to see what new and exciting things are  being offered by Doug  Robson (of LGO fame) here are Gallo .... YAWN!  First ...lemme say... I felt the staff was great... granted.. there were only 20 people in the entire restaurant;...our server was attentive and visible.     I reviewed the menu prior to arrival, so I gently advised my buds that it's not a full service restaurant,  per sea , but more of a "snack stop".   We arrived and were quickly seated; we ordered the guacamole as an appetizer, which we all enjoyed.  The  guac  arrived with a pairing of enhancement sauces which appealed to all.  The chips for dipping were extremely light and flavorful, the highlight of the meal in my opinion.  Using caution and sticking to just tacos, the three of us ordered a mix of all of the Tacos and one ordered the Cheeseburger.    The tacos arrived promptly after the appetizer, the tacos neatly presented in an accordion type metal rack. Although aesthetically pleasing, the rack was not warmed, so it basically "stole" the heat from the tacos.  Thank god it did not steal the flavor, which,...I have to say... was very nice... not FANTASTIC.. but very good.  The pork was great, nice and juicy with a somewhat sweet tang, the Carne Asada, were perfect in my opinion.. the Vegetable tacos.. very flavorful... considering it was just veggies.    My bud who ordered the hamburger was REALLY disappointed... he claimed it not cooked according to his request (medium) but very rare.  He did give kudos for presentation, but that was about it.    Would I come here again???.. perhaps.. but not to bring a first date or impress my boss... I might however, come here after a heavy night of drinking when the tummy is grumbling.  I'm hoping that Doug will "shine" in a few months and present a new menu with integrity and virtue.   I am kinda perplexed  by all the GREAT reviews of Gallo,... Many of the Yelpers have given this restaurant overwhelming great reviews... my question...is WHY???

      After enjoying the sunset with sangria and micheladas from the rooftop of the Clarendon Hotel, we headed downstairs for dinner with Mr. K and co.   We started with the guacamole, chips, and salsas, which were immediately inhaled, and then the real fun began.    Everyone cooed when the chicharrón de queso -- a crispy, light chip that's really made from melted cheese -- arrived.  It sounds weird, but is heaven on a plate.  And as the menu says, "gringos, this is not a quesadilla."   Everyone fell silent as we savored the elote (grilled corn on the cob smothered in cotija cheese and paprika).  We all fought the impulse to pick up our plates and lick off the cotija crumbs, and reached for more chips to get the last bits of cheesy, corny goodness off our plates.  Then, the awesome tacos arrived.  We opted for the cochinita (pork with a great citrus and achiote flavor) and the carne asada (beef with a nice charred tomato salsa).     The service was attentive, without interrupting us.  The flavors were phenomenal, and the prices were ridiculously reasonable.  As Mike said "it's Mexican street food done well, and still at Mexican street food prices."   Our party included five adults and a 3 year-old.  Kudos to the server, who went out of her way to grant all the wishes of the 3 year-old (and the adults) at the table.  By the time we left, we has all asked when they would be open for breakfast the next day.  That's one of the best compliments I can give a place.

      Seriously - $2 steak tacos?!!?? Awesome!   We've now been there twice in the last couple of weeks and each time have loved it. The Guac is by far my favorite part. The citrus/oranges twist is an amazing complement to the traditional pepper/onions fare. The other aspect that I loved was that it isn't grinded into a pulp. Turns out I really lie the chunky aspects of this guac. One twist that we did was ask for tortillas, vs. chips, and it turns out that they cook their own tortillas on site, so we got fresh tortillas - simply tasty.  I've tried all 4 tacos and definitely lean towards the steak (best) and pork (good second). I chased these with the watermelon-lime fresca the second time and the Periquitas ($5 red wine) the first time. Was pleasantly surprised each time.  Although I'm not a fan of frijoles (soupy beans), the beans here were as if you had some refried beans, with some whole beans, sprinkled with cotija cheese. They were very flavorful, almost a little smoky/earthy, which was a nice change from the regular old bland stuff you get at other places.

      I have been to Gallo Blanco a few times now and have always been please with both the food and the service.   Some of my favorites included the Elote Callejero wich is grilled corn covered in cotija cheese and then heavily sprinkled with smoked paprika.  $2 tacos (they're small and delicious). I've tried them all but I must say the Cochinitas (pork marinated with achiote, orange, garlic and guajillo) were the best.  I also had a white sangria (I usually prefer red but this was light and refreshing) it had lemons, grapes, mangoes, oranges, apples - delicious! They don't make it too sweet with is a big win every time.   For breakfast I tried the Huevos Rancheros and was very pleased with the spicy tomato sauce that came with it. I also ordered the Fruta con crema fresca (mixed fruit w/ whipped Crema Fresca) very fresh and nice variety of fruit.   The menu is pretty limited, but what they do  - they do well. The prices are excellent and the dining area open and airy. I can see myself frequenting this place a lot this summer.

      My lovely woman and I stayed at the Clarendon this past weekend, so we had plenty of encounters with Gallo Blanco and we dug it.  You can't go wrong with their fresh, made when you order it, guacamole and house-made tortilla chips. That is some damn good guac! In addition to the normal ingredients that you would expect (avocado, tomato, onion, spices) they also include some tangerine or a similar fruit in there, giving it a tasty variation. We ordered it as an app before dinner and also during the day while we were chillin poolside. Good stuff!  The grilled corn appetizer (Elote Callajero) with cotija cheese and smoked paprika is also a unique and tasty treat. They'll even cut it in half for ya if you want to share with someone else.  For din-din, my girl enjoyed their fish tacos more than the carne asada taco.   I was satisfied with the veggie tacos. A good mix of grilled veggies and other taco goodies was included, along with a fresh lime. Gotta love fresh lime juice squeezed on fresh ingredient packed tacos.  If you want a little somethin extra, their house-made french-fries are delicious and will only run you $2 for a side.  The dining area has large glass windows that you can sit up against, which is pretty cool and allows for a good view of the surrounding area.  The bar area had a live music performance on Saturday night, which was a welcome addition.  My only suggestion for Gallo Blanco would be to expand their drink selections and availability. I'd like to see a good pale ale (like Sierra Nevada) put on tap there. They do have a Oak Creek Hefeweisen and a Nimbus Dark Amber, so I give them props for covering those beer styles, but I still want a good pale ale.   As far as mixed drinks go, my girlfriend wanted a Strawberry Daiquiri to sip on while we were lounging poolside and they were unable to make one for us. After I found that out, I asked if they could make a strawberry anything for her and they agreed to make a strawberry margarita, although they seemed very reluctant to do so.  Overall, the environment is awesome, the service is good and the food is good. I would definitely recommend that you check it out.

      This was the first time today that I was at a restaurant surrounded by cocks. And, sadly, this wasn't as stellar an experience as I'd hoped. :(   Robert M and I went here for breakfast this morning and apparently that's a meal too early to be considered for taking here. The much-zinged about tacos wouldn't be served until 11 a.m. and it was 9:30 a.m. What to do but order a drink. We did; the bloody mary, which is made with house made charred tomatoes, pureed and served with Absolut vodka (can you believe this is their well? For sure!). We both needed to doctor up our drinks, because we like them spicier and I need salt in my everything, yet it was still short of great. Now, had I been wearing my flask belt buckle and thought ahead to fill it with vodka, this might have been a better bloody mary. With the menu limitations in mind, our choices were limited. As we were meeting up with another couple, we didn't want to eat too much and just sit and watch this couple eat, so we ordered the cheese crisp. Or was it crispy cheese? Either way, it's basically cheese toasted on a skillet until it's good and bubbly and crispy, rolled loosely and server. Good, and I'll try to make this at home. Huevos rancheros was my breakfast selection but I'd filled up too much on the crisp, water and bloody mary and wasn't able to finish it myself. Bless my pumpkin's heart, Robert finished for me.   Apparently the service was off this morning, and it was painfully obvious. From being brought juice glasses for our water (I drink a lot of water and need constant refills) to feeling like we were left to fend for ourselves throughout the meal, something definitely wasn't flowing smoothly. However, I do want to come back and give this place another try. The volume of positive reviews showcase that Gallo Blanco can provide an exceptional dining experience. Until that time, I will have to round up my 2.45 stars to 3 stars. Please, Gallo Blanco. Don't let me down next time.

      Strike the background music by the Commodores, "Three Times a Lady"..."yes, you're once, twice, THREE times a laaaady. And I loooove youuuuu!" Yep. After C4. After The Clarendon Kitchen. We now have Gallo Blanco. And I am muy happy about this. The carne asada tacos are heavenly! Perfectly seasoned and served in the cutest taco rack. I'm now combing every William Sonoma to find these puppies. Our mango fresco juice beverage thingie was so refreshing I wanted to jump right in! Rickie said the roasted chicken was succulent. Ok. So he didn't say succulent. I think yummy was the word. The decor is modern and comfortable. I love how they really opened up the room. It is light, airy and has great views. Including our bedroom window...ooops...maybe I shouldn't have mentioned that. OMG. We just confirmed our trip to Disney World! Gotta go! Oh. Eat here. NOW!

      I was so excited to hear that Doug Robson (I'm a fan of his from LGO) was opening an authentic Mexico City mexican food restaurant!  I have spent some time in Mexico City and love all the flavors of the food, the people and the culture! Doug hit in on the head with Gallo Blanco.  My family is a huge critique when it comes to guacamole and margaritas.  Everyone gave it two thumbs up and if they had 3 thumbs, they would have put the third up too!  The guac has oranges in it . . . something i never would have thought of, might even scoffed at but truly loved!  the portion is quite big so makes it great for a full table of hungry eaters!  The sangria is perfect and I heard the margaritas are better then anything my native phoenician family has had in Phoenix!  A reason to go back.    The pork tacos are divine as is their presentation and $2 price tag!  Way to keep it cheap, Doug!  I also loved the elote.  I didn't think i could eat the whole ear when it arrived at my place, but apparently, my eyes are too small for my stomach!  So yummy.

      I can't believe I found this place a month before I move to the other side of the world. Lame. I'll have to visit again before I get on the plane. The cochinitas sandwich... it is the pork to end all pork, my friends. So sweet and succulent with little crunchy bits.... mmmmm! And the chocolate pudding thing... mwah *kissy fingers*   P.S. I hate eating in the dark, but this was worth it.

      Ok let me start off by saying I have eaten at the clarendon kitchen before it was thankfully demolished. My gf got such bad food poisoning she was barfing in a Harkins Loyelty cup on the freeway, because she couldnt make it to pull over. After emtying it several times out the window to refill it, she had a cold sweat for the rest of the night.  I think she lost like 4 lbs and she is super tiny to begin with so by the next day she was skeletor... So naturally I was jealous, not really, but kinda.. no I kid, but seriously...   So enough background on the horror this spot was.   At first we were leary but when we arrived it was completely open and gutted, you could see the kitchen which for a germy like me that is a beautiful thing.   The menu is small and slightly hard to read at first.   We ordered the guacamole before I realized it was 7 bucks. When we got it it looked like the chunks would be too big for my gf liking (because I micro manage how she eats) after one bite this shit was definatly the best guac Ive had, for real. I heard about the mandarines which I actually hate, so I was a skeptic.. no it was delicious.   I got beef tacos which were melt in your mouth.  the veggie was pretty good but had mushrooms, I fucking hate mushrooms. Those sick ass little horse pissed on poop bi products.  Aside from the mushrooms it was very tasty, i would get them again minus the poopy shrooms.   Oh the best part is they serve the coke in a can and its a buck... finally someone gets that its a joke to charge 2.50 for a fucking soda.  Awesome job, Ill be coming back to try some breakfast or hang out and try that beer you doctor up.   If you ever ate at clarendon kitchen , dont be scared its nothing like that nightmare !!!!

      Gallo Blanco is a winner and the reviews below say as much. What I didn't see and wish to comment upon;  Pros-Amazingly tasty sangria, maybe the best in town; really fresh ingredients; prices that won't break the bank and special food.  Cons-the tacos are great but is there any sort of labeling you could do to designate which tacos are which? And service...please don't pull the chips off the table when we're still drinking our second sangria, especially if the restaurant is not full and no one is waiting for our table...the place is LOUD, concrete floors and windows don't help, maybe a bit of sound dampening via wall hangings or something?

      So this place was recommended to me by Dallas G which carries with it a special distinction all its own.  The first time I was forced to get the elote callejero which is a gigantic corn on the cob with seasonings and cotija cheese all over it.  Fucking delightful.  However, the watermelony water that I was forced to get was not good.  It's some drink that they have that I would not recommend to anyone.  So the next time we went I had the corn again and a torta, which is basically a sandwich with this unbelievably savory bread.  Like I've been to five or so different spanish speaking countries now and a torta pretty much means something different in each one, but this was ridiculously good.  So on the merits of the two food items I've gotten I give five glorious stars, brought back to earth by the crappy drink.  Four stars.  Go there, get the food, skip the watermelon goo and you will have a truly delightful meal.

      First visit  last night. Very happy to see something great go into the Clarendon. Cool to see that little burst of red popping out the front with the glass hinting at people and activity inside. There will be more visits!   FOOD Dig the simple menu. More places should try this: find a few things to make very well, and execute on them. Keep it simple. Add more only as you can do so without lessening the consistency and quality of your core menu.  So far, only had the tacos. They were fresh-tasting, well-seasoned and overall, delicious. A little on the sweet side, but the balance was there. Only critique is to echo that maybe the little metal radiators, while effective at display and containment of tacos, might be dissipating the heat of the food too quickly. Some other more insular, less conductive material might be a better (more expensive?) approach.  Definitely trying the tortas with egg next time.  DRINK Small, but interesting selection. Started with the Madre cocktail. Very fresh grapefruit/citrus flavor. No extra sweetener detected. Also, no vodka detected; but that could be my Irish liver or the power of fresh-squeezed juice. Next a glass of Lo Brujo - bright, minerally refreshing Spanish white. Enough citrus to balance out the mineral and the body.  Both beverages were excellent summer fare.   Updates to follow :-D

      I dig this place, I really do, but the portions are small. They do make up for it  by packing a straight kick to your man or woman pleaser with zesty flavors. I didn't dig the guacamole-too much salt, but loved, loved, loved the chips that came with it. The place is quite spacious and modern with featured art on the walls. I went for dinner so the lighting was minimal giving the place a sexy, urban feel to it. The kind of lighting that makes you wonder if the people are really this good looking? Or is the lighting really just this good???   The carne asada beef tacos were divine. Really moist and succulent with just enough spice to make your taste buds tingle. Two is hardly enough, so we also tried the fish tacos and well, I could smell the fishiness from across the table which makes me a little uncomfortable. I did try it, though and it was okay. Not too fond of anything that tastes or smells too fishy. Reminds me of unsanitized, dirty, dirty girls. (Haha, had to throw in a visual for you all!)  My favorite plate was the ensalada cortada. I loved all the ingredients mixed in together, especially the corn nuts. Genius idea!   For drinks, I had the la sangria. Fruity, refreshing, and light tasting. It was really good, but I passed it on to my date in hopes of taking advantage of him later on. Almost worked, but when we got to the normally secluded rooftop @ the Clarendon hotel, they were hosting a social gathering of some sort with lots of people. Damn. Should've drank my sangria. Oh well...another day since I will most definitely be back for some more Gallo Blanco. I can't wait to try their breakfast menu!

      Carne asada torta+over easy egg=redemption.  I now get why there are so many Gallo Blanco lovers out there. Thanks for making me one of them. It was too big for me to eat in one sitting and filled the to-go container almost to capacity, and I actually devoured half of it.

      Since the first time I have visited GB, it has warmed up quite a bit--- I am not certain they have the proper A/C unit for this space..... seriously, it was an OVEN in there multiple times this summer.  So these 2 stars are just for the SWAMPY feeling and massive heat stroke I nearly experienced in GB.   I will not be returning until AFTER the summer....

      I'm not a huge fan of guac, but Gall Blanco showed me that there's delicious guac to be had. Nom nom. The other "oh my gosh" find was the corn. Who thought that someone would order corn on the cob as an appetizer? If I didnt before, I do now. Delicious!  Big thanks to Gallo Blanco for hosting the "kiteup"; aka get-together with about 50 Brightkite users. It was indeed warm inside, but with that many people crammed into a small space, it'd be hard to expect otherwise.
