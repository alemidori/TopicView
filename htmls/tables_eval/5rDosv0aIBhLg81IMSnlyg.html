      The best bone-in rib-eye I have ever had in my life.  The Steve Wynn Steakhouse sits down the escalators and opens up to the man-made private lake of the Wynn Hotel.  There has been a lot of locals alike who remain unimpressed by Wynn but I beg to differ.  While Bellagio really changed what one could expect to Vegas, Wynn's position is more subtle.  It is more private, quieter, and it's elegance doesn't shout at you.  Feel it and breathe it in.  The big plus for those who are used to fine dining from a NY or SF, the prices at Wynn are not that bad.  I took 3 others with me and the bill was less than $500 with cocktail and wine.  The cap of the night was to have Steve Wynn, the modern day Da Vinci, and one of the top business men sit two tables away...10-minutes later Mick Jagger joins Wynn for dinner.  My party were amazed.  Pos: excellent steaks, nice lake views, for those looking for a more elegant ambiance compared to the Nines Steakhouse at Palm or other restaurant.  Negs: None noted

      Very nice steakhouse atmosphere and great service. The wine list is large, but not over whelming. The appetizers were small in portions, but great tasting. The steak that I had was cooked to perfection and tasty. The Australian lobster tail was out of this world. The sides were just the right size and good. The view of the water fall adds to the luxury of this place. I would definitely come back to the Steve Wynn Steakhouse!

      I went here recently with a group of 6...It was not pleasant. I will not be back.  #1-Steak orders...of 5 orders, not a single one was done correctly, even by THEIR standards. Uneven, overcooked, undercooked...you name it.  #2-No problem...you just tell your waiter and he'll make it right...right??? Um...no...the waiter did one of the fastest drive-bys I have EVER seen at ANY restaturant. He was actually running past us as he said "is everything ok?" and wasn't even within earshot by the time we responded 1 second later.  #3-Our reservation was lost. As we were there for a special event, and everything thusfar had been going well, we rolled with it... That is...until the host told us that he had a table, but we were going to have to give it up by 8pm. That left us with exactly 95 minutes to sit, order, sort through the screwups and pack out of there. It didn't happen.  On a good note...our somalier took some requests from us to find a wine suitable to our likes. It sure seemed easier than sorting through their 12 billion listings. What he selected was the best, most accurate selection I have ever tasted. NO arguments here.  Their "shows" aren't worth sticking around for more than once. Yeah...they're something new...but they're stale quickly.

      The SW Steakhouse is located in the new and fabulous Wynn Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.   I was under the impression that the SW stood for South West....WRONG!!!  The S W stands for Steve Wynn the hotel owner.    The menu at the SW Steakhouse features some of Mr. Wynn's favorite fare.  There are of course steaks, but they also have excellent seafood, beautiful salads, excellent appetizers (try the lobster rolls), decadent desserts..AND a big plate of sausage.  That is right....a plate of sausages from around the globe.  An international plate of sausage if you will.  The service is stellar, the wine list expansive, the decor beautiful and the food is delicious.  Ask for a table with a view of the gorgeous water fall/fountain.  At night it changes colors and shows graphics.  It is really beautiful.

      Decent steakhouse, but not the "best of the best' as Wynn is outspoken about. The steaks were cooked well, but the meat quality is mediocre. Their rib-eye was a bit fatty and had too many tendons. It didn't taste like a well-aged steak. Their sides were excellent as were other dishes, such as their scallops and oysters. Overall I would have given this place four stars for all of their food, but it's a steakhouse and that's where I'm weighing my review.  Also I know I'm from Chicago (and a lover of meats) when I looked at their menu and read that their 40 ounce porterhouse was for two and thought it should be for one.

      You gotta pay to play in Vegas and it's no different with this place.  But, the bone-in ribeye is well worth it and not much more expensive than other nice steak joints out there.  Wine list was too snobbish ($$$) for my taste but hey if you love how the grape bursts with flavor on your tongue then you will enjoy it.  Waited a bit despite a reservation (why even bother with reservations?!) and was mildly amused by a poor man's Bellagio waterfall show by the entrance.  If you love a juicy steak and have actually made some money gambling, then this is your spot and if you won a lot of money then you might even order one of their wines.

      For starters I'm not really a 'Steak Guy'.  I like steak enough I'm just rarely in the mood for it and it's never something i crave.  We dined at SW @ The Wynn last night and while the staff was great and the wine list was well rounded I felt the food and the atmosphere were just OK.    The decor looks like just about any hotel restaurant in any big city and doesn't really have an distinguishing features.  The tables are nice and big and our table of 7 had plenty of room for glasses, side plates etc.    As for the menu the starters looked more inter sting then the mains for the most part.  I guess if you are looking for a straight-ahead steak then you'd not be disappointed.  The Roasted Hen was also quite nice as was the rack of lamb.  My heirloom tomato was trying a little to hard and over sauced.    Maybe I'm just not used to the no frills attitude that most steak houses tend to rock and need to adjust my expectations.  The nice thing about the Wynn is that there's always somewhere else to try.

      Great food, but over priced...vastly overpriced...and small portions.  It isn't good enough for the price.  I would go to Flemmings before I eat here again.  If you have enough money it isn't a bad investment, but there is a lot better bargains out there with just as good food.

      The best place to dine and by far my best meal in Vegas! I made a reservation there for my Birthday dinner, during my trip to Vegas. My girlfriends and I couldn't have been more pleased! I ordered a magnum bottle of champagne, the oysters on the half shell, oysters Wynn, and the crabcake appetizers. For entrees we ordered the Fillet Mignon, wild Scottish Salmon, and the sushi grade Blue Fin Tuna. The best tuna I've eaten since dinning at Morimoto's in Philly. To top off the meal we ordered the fabulous, little, chocolate souffle...AMAZING!    The whole dinning experience there was unforgettable! The atmosphere, food, service! We sat outside by the water which was just great because it is relaxing and every half an hour they have a little water show.     I highly recommend this restaurant. I do plan on returning if ever in Vegas again. Just be sure you're aware of the high prices that come along with the fine dinning experience!

      Steakhouses are hard to review. Good steak is not actually that hard to come by. I cannot say that the steak here was somehow "so much more steak-y" than other fine establishments.  But I can say that the these guys can do more than just steak. They think they're a french restaurant. The rest of the menu is stronger than most traditional steakhouse. It's good, but I won't say that their other dishes are as good a proper french restaurant.  The steak was good, though. What I would recommend is that you order the steak "for two". It's served cut, and the kitchen does a much better job making the initial cuts than you would so little juice is wasted.  Ok, so there's this weird "show" that you watch during dinner. Don't get your hopes up here; it stuck most as surreal rather than entertaining or even appetizing. It's very Cirque de Soleil.  The show had to compete with the clientele. I've never seen so many attractive and well-heeled people in one restaurant in my life. Eye-candy abounds. Might want to iron your shirt before you come.  So why only three stars? Low taste/dollar. I guess if you really want great French food in Vegas, you're better off going to a real French restaurant. If you want really good steak, you might as well pay a bit less and go to BOA or one of the many, many others.

      Not much mystery about what this restaurant serves, eh? Now, as to the name...Steve Wynn has a healthy ego. This restaurant bears his initials (another restaurant - Wing Lei - is the Chinese version of his name). I'm not really a steak person. However, I had heard good things about SW, and in any case was trying to eat my way though Wynn.  In some ways, the atmosphere is typical steakhouse: busy and noisy. There are lots of browns and tans. The restaurant has a view of the Wynn water show. However, my table was too far away to see anything except for colors reflected off the trees. Service was generally efficient, and courses were well paced. Minor issues: my server was slow to take my order; my server and various assistants came across as a bit impersonal.  On to the meal! *  Foie Gras Duo. The first was pate de foie gras with specs of truffle, some fruit puree for sweetness, and toasted brioche. It was buttery, creamy, smooth, with pretty good flavor. Rating: good to very good. The second was sauted foie gras on a bed of nectarines and onions. It was a very large hunk of foie gras - rich and flavorful. It lost a few points because it was so thick that there was too much soft insides as compared to the seared outside. Still, very good to excellent. *  Filet Mignon with Three Sauces. The filet was about 2-1/2 inches thick, crusty, maybe with butter on it. It cut easily, was tender as could be, but also had excellent flavor - the best steak I've ever had. The Bernaise sauce was my favorite: thick, rich, tangy, wonderful in every way. *  Baby vegetables (string beans, yellow squash, carrots, pea pods). They were pretty good, but too crisp even for me, a crisp vegetable lover.   Of the three steak houses I've visited (including Delmonico and StripSteak), SW Steakhouse is my favorite. That's from an admittedly small group of restaurants, but I was impressed.

      My wife and I loved this place.  I can see why it is rated as one of the top steakhouses in Las Vegas.  My NY Strip was wonderful, but the halibut my wife ordered was extraordinary.  It could not have been more perfect.  The steakhouse is right next to the evening light show that the Wynn puts on.  We sat by the window and got a wonderful view of the goings on.  Get there after sundown to enjoy the show.  It is rather pricey, as are many of the Wynn restaurants, but it is worthy of a special occasion... like your wife's birthday.

      I have never eaten a meal that made me want to stand up and rub beef all over my naked body in a restaurant...but damn it it's that F-ing good!!!!!!!!!!!  I actually, ready for this...hold on for the shock ...spent $180 on a steak. Not a steak to share with a party of four, but A steak. Now I know what you're thinking...5 stars a $180 steak, I must hear more...and you shall.  I have eaten at SW a few times now and never once even come close to JUST happy. I have always left ecstatic! The $180 steak was a true Wagyu Kobe beef steak and something that still brings tears to my eyes every time I think of it. The wine list is incredible and the deserts are out of this world. If you go when its not too hot they have a killer patio over a giant pond that spits out an occasional light show. While we were there the chef made the rounds and asked how the $180 steak was...did I tell you I paid $180 for a steak and was OK with it?  To top the night off, there was a bachlor party of some kind in a private room in the back. At one point during the meal a Korean man came running through the restaurant with a bikini brief a hat with his clothes in his arms...and nobody looked twice.  That;s why I love VEGAS!!!!!

      I LOVE this Place!!!!  We always make a point to have a meal @ SW when we are visiting the Sin City.   We started our meal with Foie Gras, two dozen oysters, and  Sashimi salad.  They were all great, but my favorite is the Foie Gras!!! YUMMY!!! We ordered Seared Hawaiian Tuna, Halibut, Scallops, Rib Eye steak, and Filet Mignon. For side dishes we've ordered Au Gratin potatoes, Truffled creamed corn, and Creamed Spinach...  My Rib Eye was really tender and good... However, we ALL agree that the Seared Tuna was the BEST!!!!!  WOW,  it just melted in your mouth and was seasoned PERFECT!!!  We love this place.. However, the BEST was our most AWESOME Sommelier Noel.   His level of customer service and knowledge he has with wine is by far the BEST!!!!  He is one of the main reason why we LOVE SW Steakhouse so much!!!!   We finished our dinner by ordering cheese cake, sorbet trio, and cream Brulee.. AND by Noel's recommendation, shot of Nocello Walnut Liquor..  WOW, it was so delicious!!!  We walked out FULL and Happy!!!  I can't wait til our next Vegas trip!!!!

      Our host got us last-minute reservations to the Steakhouse and it was the best!  My bone-in NY steak was mouth watering and cooked to perfection.  The accompanying 3 sauces were equally delicious - I dipped each bite of my steak into a different sauce each time and by the end of the meal, I still couldn't decide which sauce was my favorite.  My husband had the filet mignon and lobster - FANTASTIC!  Our best steakhouse meal ever!  Of course, service was right-on!

      Recently usurped Peter Luger as my favorite steakhouse.  We ordered the porterhouse for 2 which was charred to perfection on both sides.  SW broils their steaks (as does Peter Luger and Ruth's Chris) which I think results in better flavor than grilling.  The meat was tender and full of flavor.  The steak came with a few sauces, which I completely ignored since i couldn't imagine putting anything on such a well-cooked steak.  As I was eating my steak, I thought, "The only steak that edges this one out is Peter Luger."  Then I went to Peter Luger's twice in the following two months and no, Peter Luger's did not edge out SW.  SW was, in my book, a much better steak.  The decor was setting was also very nice.  We had a table by the man-made pool thing where we saw some shows that looked like they came from a grown-up Disneyland on acid.

      Best steak I have ever had.  My 12 ounce filet mignon was done perfectly as was companion's bone-in rib eye.  It was crisp on the outside and moist and tender on the inside.  Medium rare was perfectly executed.  The only downside were the sauces, the white (SW) one was okay, and the rest were inedible.  But, I went for the steak and not for the sauces.  The bread was also excellent, and the sides were fantastic (creamed corn and yukon potatoes).    The atmosphere was wonderful.  Definitely go after dark.  The waterfall is so beautiful with different lightly, giving it a romantic and beautiful atmosphere.  Also, sit outside on the patio if you can.  Cost is approximately $100 per person, but my steak was worth every cent!

      Steakhouse perfection.  The food and service were outstanding, and the water-feature, which all of the outdoor tables and some of the indoor tables have a beautiful view of, is absolutely gorgeous (the Lake at Bellagio has nothing on this water show at the Wynn).  Even if the weather is cool, I HIGHLY recommend getting an outdoor table. They have tons of space heaters and will also lend you a Pashmina wrap, if you're chilly.   Save extra room for dessert. We split a fantastic key lime tart, and then the server brought exquisite handmade truffles with the check that I wished I had saved  more room for.

      Tried quite a handful of steak houses in Vegas over the years and this came away with the best combination of service, appetizers, and steak.  The seared Toro at $35 is worth every bite, and the Chicago-style crusted/charred Rib Eye at 20oz is an excellent finish.  Portions so big we could care less about desserts.  Cut the grease with a fine red from their extensive selection, then head out to the bar for a light show and coffee.  Steak has been the staple of many a customer meetings in Vegas, and I'll definitely be visiting this one on my own dime when I'm there.  Preferred the service , meat, and pricing to Prime in Bellagio, which was our destination the previous night.  Would have been perfect if: - the steak accompaniments matched that of Prime - the waiter not knowing what a Caipirinha is ;-)

      One of the more memorable 9 oz. filets I've ever had, just cooked to perfection with a nice outer crust.  Heaven with a pink center.  Overall, a very good meal.  Wife had the Caesar salad, which I got to taste.  Very simple, very classic, very well done.  The crouton was amazing.  I went for an appetizer special:  Tuscan salami and duck ham over greens and mushrooms.  The salami was excellent, but everything else seemed to be overly competitive on the plate.  There was a lot going on.  I didn't care for any of the sauces that they present with the steaks, but then again I rarely put anything on a steak these days aside from the tines of my fork.  I had a side of truffled creamed corn, which just didn't work for me.  I enjoy hints of flavors and found the truffle a bit over the top and overwhelming.  Wife had the beef short ribs, which were outstanding, though I found the sauce to be a bit on the rich side.  For dessert we shared a nightly special chocolate souffle.  It was amazing.  It was well accompanied by a very nice cup of cappuccino.  The service was top-notch, attentive, and timely.  Overall, a very good experience worth the money.

      I went with my cutie petutie for our anniversary and it was a memorable night.  The service was excellent... it felt like we had a 2:1 server to client ratio.  People were popping out of nowhere to refill water, bring us bread, serve appetizers and the main meals.    The food was great as well... our steaks were cooked to perfection and I recommend getting your steak topped with the crispy garlic and rosemary.  Absolutely fantastic!  My cutie petutie didn't mind the water show and talked me out of reducing the rating from 5 to a 4.  I personally thought the water show was cheesy and almost distracting to the nice evening.    We already planned our next anniversary... we will be heading back the SW!

      As with any Las Vegas experience SW Steakhouse is over-the-top and outrageously good. Choosing to remain at the bar as opposed to taking a table, myself and a friend must have spent 3+ hours sipping, tasting, and socializing in the bar. Nothing against the restaurant dining room, which is like most any other fine dining room in Las Vegas, but sometimes it really kills the buzz to sit-down for a quiet dinner when you're in the mood just to have a good time.  So, instead we sat at the bar and socialized our way through various appetizers, entrees, and bottles of wine.  The chilled Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail was out of this world. Of course so was the price at $20, but it is Vegas after all. Nothing comes cheep, so be prepared to spend. We also had a caprese type dish, which was disappointing because of the mushy tomatoes, but I don't even know if it was on the menu so that's probably just what we get. Making up for that mistake we ordered the Filet with blue cheese that was amazing as well.  The wine list was extensive, specifically focusing on big reds from California, Italy, and France. We had a bottle of Shafer Merlot and a Brunello (this was the second bottle so the name escapes me). Overall, our experience was quite enjoyable as I'm sure the bartender, hostesses, and any guest passing through the bar could attest to. Enjoy!

      Went there with my girfriend on Spring Break. Probably one of the nicest and best restaurants I've been to. The view alone was worth the money!

      Now this is what a Vegas steakhouse should be like.  Excellent service, delicious meal, great atmosphere, and a stunning waterfall in the distance.  Perfect.  It was way too hot outside, so we opted for an inside seat with a view of the waterfall.  The crab cakes for our appetizers were divine.  Our steaks, mine the filet, his the rib-eye, were both cooked to perfection.  The creamed spinach just melted in my mouth, and the potatoes au gratin was so rich and creamy - to our horror - we just couldn't finish it all!   How sad it was to watch them take it away.   We were too full to have any dessert.  Our waiter was very nice and made the overall experience of the restaurant a memorable last night of our vacation.  As it should be, this is a 'nice' restaurant that prefers their guests to dress accordingly, and I've seen them turn people away.  Nothing irks me more than someone walking into a 5 star restaurant in ripped jeans and a dirty t-shirt, when everyone else is in semi-formal dress.  Make an effort.
