      You know how Costco brands are like real clothes but without any kind of flair or frills? I mean, they seem nice... they just aren't nice. They are called Kirkland, right? I think Harrah's is the Kirkland Hotel for everyone that wants to stay in Vegas without shelling out for the Venetian or the Wynn.

      I got hooked up with a suite with a nice view overlooking the Strip. I'm sure it's not as fancy as the Bellagio or the Venetian, but I wasn't planning on spending my whole weekend indoors anyway. No hype, no frills, just straight forward. You're only going to be in your room to shower and store your baggages anyway, right? If so, this is the place to stay.  It's located right across from Caesar's Palace and next to the Venetian. Great location without the overpriced rates.

      I just found out that Harrah's is the largest hotel/casino operator in the world.  I am completely amazed.  I have been to several of the Harrah's locations and never, ever thought they would be the biggest.  Based on the level of service, they are just "ok".  Spend your dollars elsewhere.

      Now this review is based on the rooms.  Some girlfriends and I stayed here last summer and our rooms had been recently remodeled.  It was pleasantly surprising to not see a glammed Mardi Gras explosion in the rooms.  Very well chosen colors and pieces.

      Decent clean rooms...  I spent a weekend here after a full business week at the Venetian.  It's not fair to compare this hotel to it's fancier neighbors.    The room I had was not updated.  It did however have a view of the strip and the pool.  The lack of luxury, refinement and decor may be intentional in order to get you out of the rooms and into the action downstairs.  I've also stayed at the Harrah's RENO (see: http://www.yelp.com/biz/arjkq9xxhTjwmncEsXNRmQ?hrid=iIHlVDcjq2I8V7mghTvt1Q ).  The Reno property rooms in the West Tower feel like the "W Hotel" - cool, chic, and modern.  The Harrah's Vegas felt like a retro 80's style Holiday Inn.  3 Stars for the central location, clean rooms, and great service...

      BIG MONEY....  Every time I play the dollar slots here I win big... well sorta big ~$300 or more.  The casino decor isn't that great, and the bar outside is annoying, but it looks so much better after I pull that wad of money from the machine.

      You can come to Vegas 5 times in a year and have a different trip every time.  Harrah's is great because it's in the middle of the strip and it's a bedroom to stay in.  If I wanted a resort, I wouldn't have come to vegas.

      Great location and I love gambling at the casino. My complaints: When I checked in, I gave the girl a $20 bill asking if there were any better rooms available than a standard eluxe. She made it seem like she was putting me in a suite, and when I walked in, it was....a standard Deluxe room.  Small and very, very standard. Maid service wasn't very good even though I tipped her everyday I was there... The buffet was superb, although I was too hungover to fully enjoy it. All in all, it's a solid 4 stars. I can't really complain since my room was comped, but I'd be VERY disappointed if I paid the $1200 to stay there for the week.

      Harrah's isn't that bad of a place.  The prices are a steal ($29, if you are a Gold member), and their location is in the middle of the Strip.  You can easily access the Mirage, Venetian, and Caesar's Palace on foot.  Plus, Harrah's is one of the stops for the monorail.  The rooms aren't flashy, but they are surprisingly larger than some of their competitors.  I didn't really use any of the facilities in Harrah's besides gambling there.  I basically stayed at Harrah's to sleep and prepare myself for the next day's activities.  I would just stay here to sleep and eat and gamble somewhere else.  At $29 and at a prime location, Harrah's is a steal.

      Harrah's is a great place to stay if you want to save some cash for gambling or shopping but still be on the strip and have access to everything.....it's across the street from Ceasars Forum Shops and Treasure Island, next to the Venitian and close to the Wynn and the Mirage.    The hotel itself is pretty outdated but the staff is extremely attentive and friendly.  If you decide to stay at Harrah's I suggest you book a room in the Mardi Gras Tower.  The rooms in this tower have recently been remodeled with nice funishings, comfortable beds, and flat screens in the bathrooms.  STAY AWAY from the rooms in the Carnival Tower-they are outdated, run-down and smelly.  The pool is small and nothing special compared to the pools at the nicer casinos (but that should be expected).  When we stayed for a night last weekend it was packed and the water looked very dirty-ewww.   So, we just  decided to lay out under the misters that line the upper deck- a nice touch for those who don't want to swim but still want to  stay cool.  We ordered room service late and it was reasonably priced for Vegas but the food was only so-so.  The Toby Keith bar and grill is kind of fun and the Carnival Court bar is crazy and loud-like spring break is happening there ALL THE TIME.   All in all, I would recommend staying at  Harrah's but only in the remodeled rooms in the Mardi Gras tower.  It is a good value for the price and you can't beat the location on the strip!

      While its not the flashiest or trendiest casino on the strip- I think this is one of the most fun casinos. They have reasonable minimums on the tables, great bartenders and a fun, festive atmosphere. I've ended up here almost every visit to Vegas- even when staying at places that look a lot "better".  I love the piano bar, its a blast. They also have some great comedy shows.  Next time I might just stay here and save myself a lot of walking!

      This is the best place to stay if you're wanting to stay near the center of the strip but not wanting to fork out a couple hundred bucks a night to do it.  The rooms were clean and tidy.  My only complaint was that I was certain there would be a fridge to store ice and other drinks, but there wasn't.  The hotel is conveniently located near the monorail, which is at the back of the hotel.  This is the easiest and by far the cheapest mode of transportation to various places on the strip.  The dealers in the casino were very friendly and helpful.  I had never gambled at a casino before, so the first dealer I encountered had no problem explaining the particular rules while gambling and also gave me tips on certain situations during blackjack.  I will have no hesitation booking a room here the next time I go to Vegas.

      I played my first table game (Triple Play) here. The dealer was so nice She was having a great time with us. She would even cheer when we won. When she had to leave to go to another table we were so sad but the guy that came after here was just as nice. After playing for awhile we got up to go cash out. Even the cashier was nice. Overall I had a great experience. The music was great and one of the managers even gave us beads to wear. It was truly like a party.   So why only three stars???? Well the place was SUPER noisy and the drinks were disgusting. I think something was wrong with there sour mix. Yuck!

      Having never been to Vegas, until last year--we crashed with some friends that were staying at the Harrahs. It was  free, so there's really nothing complain about.    The rooms were nice and comfy but the casino kicks ass. I won nearly a grand on slots alone!  I'll be going in Jan '08, already booked a premium room for a weekend at an astronomical low rate--it was practically comped. It does pay to register with their reward program   I can't wait!!

      FAQ  Q: Don't the clowns/masquerade-ball-type statues freak you out? A: Try being on the tail-end of a three day bender and wandering up the strip and looking up to see this abomination. That will freak you out.  Q: Do they still have Triple Shot? A: You mean that crazy 3-in-1 game? I sure hope so. War, Blackjack, and then 5-card stud? What a brilliant game for all of us who have ADD. Always bet the Hat Trick.  Q: What else is great about this place? A: I suppose it's in a prime location, otherwise, I have been way too frightened to go beyond the first row or two of tables and slots.  FYI ... That Triple Shot game is a tourist trap and a scam. Don't play it and certainly don't continue to play it thinking you'll get your money back. In fact, why would even think like that? What a mistake. What a hassle. Unless you're semi-pro/pro at non-scam games.

      the WORST. I had to spend a week in this garbage pit. we had reservations, but they put me in a smoking room, it STANK. They didn't bother to call and let me know if a non smoking room would become available. The cable channel I was watching went out, and they didn't fix it. I had to argue with them about getting a free movie since the only channel I wanted to watch wasn't working.  I was there for a convention, not gambling. I just wanted to come back to my room and relax away from the crowds for a couple hours before sleeping.  I've worked in a hotel before and I wouldn't have ever treated a guest like they treated me. Will never stay in a Harrah's anywhere again, and will always recommend against Harrah's Las Vegas. I don't know how much a normal stay in Vegas is, but we paid around $144 a night.

      I am not a high roller but I got a very nice room here at Harrah's.  I arrived early and I was allowed to check in early.  They were very hospitable.  The room was marvelous!  They have a TV even in the bathroom.  I loved this hotel / casino.  This hotel is so complete, there are not many reasons to venture outside of this hotel while in Vegas. I just loved it.  Plus, Harrah's has a regular shuttle to Rio.  If you go to Vegas, try to stay at Harrah's!

      I went to Harrah's for a few days on the weekend following Thanksgiving, a relatively slow time.  For $55 I cannot complain, but I can see why it was so cheap.  The room had almost no light, even with the shades drawn and the lights on.  The toilet seat had a few drops of dried urine on it when we arrived.  There seemed to be a trace of lipstick or nail polish on one of the towels.  On my last morning, housekeeping must have knocked on the door or attempted to get in 3 times within an hour. Talk about giving the bum's rush...  There are ads for the Rita Rudner comedy act EVERYWHERE.  They bombard you with them all over town.  She instantly became a huge inside joke for us and I am sure for many others as well.  The casino is kind of lame, although the dealers are very friendly and helpful.  Everywhere you look you'll see "real 'mericans." You know who I'm talking about.  The overweight, often geriatric, blue collar types from the flyover states.  Nothing against good honest folk, that was just my impression of the clientele that you would rub shoulders with here.  Overall, I have to say this place kinda sucks, but then again, it's Vegas, you don't come here for R&amp;R and you're doing something wrong if you're spending enough time in your room that it's a major issue for you.    Bottom line: if you're going to Vegas to have some fun with your buddies, this place does the job for its price.  If you're trying to be a baller and impress the ladies, look elsewhere.

      Once in a great while we get comp rooms from Harrah's and we sure take them up on their offers. I really like the central location of Harrah's to all the other casinos on the strip. The rooms are decent, no splashy stylish posh place but a good room to sleep away your losses or the alcohol. The rail system stops here just in case you wanna take a trip to the other hotels including Paris, and The MGM Grand. The casino has a large range of slot machines from penny slots to high roller slots. I got hooked on Wheel of Fortune, but now it sucks since they lowered the max win.

      Completely exceeded all expectations!  I love the Total Rewards program and I am by no means a big spender (my parents are each Diamond members, but I can hardly break 1,000 comp points).  I reserved my room through their website and got a great deal on a large room that had a king size bed, sitting area, and two flat screen tv's - one in the main room and one in the bathroom.  The staff treated me very well and the bed was beyond comfortable.  The casino is pretty large and there is a monorail station on site for quick access to everywhere on the strip.  Seriously, I was more than surprised and for the price you get MORE than you pay for (yes, it's actually possible, even in Las Vegas).

      --------------- Update 05/16/08 ---------------------------------------------- Dropping 1 star from 5 to 4.  I played my 2nd tournament in March 2008 and stayed here since the tournament was actually held here.  I just thought it'd be more convenient and I wouldn't have to get up as early as if I had stayed at another hotel.    The room, although newly decorated (yes, only decorated with new beddings, not renovated), was barely a 3-star quality.  The bathroom was very small with only 1 sink.  My fiance and I could not be in there at the same time or we'd bump into each other.  Literally they didn't do anything to improve the room/bathroom.  There was barely enough drawer space for you to store your t-shirt, socks, and what not,  and very little room to hang your nice clothes.  Forget about staying here for more than 3 days/2 nts, you don't have enough storage!!!  And I pack VERY LIGHT when I travel.    Now I'd rather stay at Harrah's other hotels and get up 1/2 hr early than stay here.  I am also not very happy with their new comp system.    --------------- Original Review ------------------------------------------------ I am not writing about the casino itself because I have not actually stayed here myself.  I have, however, given free rooms to my friends.  The last time I got a Jr. Suite which I thought was really nice.  I am writing about the pIayer's card program.   LOVE the Total Rewards program.  You must get one if you come to Vegas.  I am a diamond card holder.  I get comp rooms (at all Harrah's chain - Caesars Palace, Paris, Rio, Flamingo, Bally's, Harrah's........), comp food, and all the invitational events (slot tournaments, black jack tournaments, and poker tournaments, etc).  And I LOVE the diamond lounge where I can get free drinks, free food, and free desserts all day long!  Sometimes we go from one diamond lounge to another (like from Caesears to Paris) because they serve different foods.  Once a year, I also get to exchange my points for gifts at the great gift wrap event.  I got an ESQ diamond watch, Toaster/Pizza Oven, Alarm Clock, Cordless Phone, Mini Deep Fryer, just to name a few for this year.    And this year, I finally got a chance to play at a poker tournament!  I've wanted to play poker in person for the longest time.  The couple of times I made plans to play in the 'by-invitation-only' poker tournaments at Vegas, I had to cancel due to my work schedule.  When I received another invitation for 12/20 - 12/23, I just had to take it.  Like Allen said, what better way to practice with casino money playing for real?  We arrived just before midnight on 12/20/07.  The next day I registered and was put on the 1:00pm round.  I had to be one of the last 2 finalists on my table (of 10) to qualify for the 2nd day's.  My goal was actually not to be the 1st one out of my table.  You can imagine my surprise when I actually made the finalist!!!  Holly cow!!!  Each person was given a bank roll of $1500 chips.  There were a number of people on the table who play poker regularly at the casino and my heart was pounding really hard when the game first began.  The dealers were the ones who actually deal at the WSOP and the tables used where the ones used at WSOP with the logos on them.  How cool was that?   The second day I sat down and I knew right away it was a different crowd.  There were around 300 people and I was playing among the 'professionals'.  Allen even pointed out someone at my table he had observed the day before and said 'Watch her, she is a pro.'  OMG!  She was not the only pro, they were all regulars.  You could tell just by the way they played with the chips which really irritated the heck out of me.   We each got $5000 bank roll.  The blinds started at $100/$200 with no ante, then every 20 minutes it went up, $200/$400, $400/$800.......  I actually made it through the first break and had to move on to other tables 3 times as people got eliminated.  When the blinds went up to $1500/$3000 with an ante of $400, I knew my time was up.  I had put out $3000 big blind and had a 4/10 non-suitted hand but had to play it b/c some guy had raised the bet and I wouldn't have enough even for the blinds for the next hand.  Well, I left the tournament in 63rd place out of around 1300 people and won $50!!!!   I was really proud of how long I lasted despite the fact that I was dealt really lousy hands.  Seriously, I had no luck at all what-so-ever.  It was frustating because I really wanted to have one big hand that I would able to say 'All in'.  LOL!  The couple of times I was able to do that and won, it was such a thrill.   I can't wait until I get another invitation from the casino.  Hopefully it'd be on a weekend instead of week days.  I have not yet played poker in a casino poker room with my own money but I am a lot more confident now and I think I might just try it one of these days.  Sorry, this turned out to be more of a 'blog' than a revi

      As far as staying here goes, the rooms are definitely "Holiday Inn" status, however, the prices for a room are quite reasonable if you're on a college student budget like I am. Other than that, a great reason to stay here is the fact that it's smack dab in the middle of the strip so you're not too far from everything. Except if you're at Stratosphere and you need to get to MGM, but that's another story.  The buffet is ok and it gets the job done if you're looking to get full. I wouldn't compare it to like Rio buffet or the Wynn buffet.   However, if you're looking to play here, two words.... SPORTS BAR. It's kinda hidden behind a row of slot machines but it's not as crowded as it is on the main floor and I know you get free alcohol playing at the tables, but the bar at the Sports Bar is the only I bar on the strip inside a casino that I know of, that has a happy hour. TWO for ONE, BABY!! Even if you lose, you win! Hahahahahah...

      For 55$ a night, you get  1.  A clean nice room (I thought it was just as nice as the rooms at Paris/Caesars) 2.  Great location on the strip 3.  Located directly next to the Ghiradhelli ice cream parlor :)  Can't beat it.  I'd totally stay there again, and I'm a bit of a snob.

      I can't complain because our rooms were comped (that means free), but there really wasn't much fancy about our room unless you count having a flat-screen TV next to the crapper as fancy. But who really cares about the room when you're in Vegas? What's important is if you can navigate the hotel and find your room at 6am while being in drunksleep.  Things I don't like about Harrah's and/or complaints about Vegas in general: 1. It's on the strip. The strip is lame and full of assholes. This area is not pedestrian-friendly. You have to walk 5 miles out of the way to cross the street or hail a cab and pay $5 to cross the street.  2. You can smoke in this hotel. Join the rest of the 21st century Vegas. Smoking kills and people don't like smelling like smoke. But you can smoke anywhere in Vegas, so I'm not singling out Harrah's.  3. Where the hell is your swimming pool? I couldn't find it. Your arrows pointed me to an empty hallway.  Things I liked about Harrah's:  1. $3.50 Heineken Keg Cans in the lobby store. Now, that's the cheapest beer you're gonna get in Vegas.  2. I watched Family Guy while I took a crap.  3. I won $190 on one hand of Texas Hold'em Bonus.

      I was pleasantly surprised by Harrah's.  I think the key is to request a renovated room.  We had a flat screen TV in our BATHROOM!  You'd think that'd be useless, but actually....  Anyways, we had a kick out of that.  The rooms are nice, and there's a flat screen outside of the bathroom too.  For an average of ~$80 a night before tax, I was very pleased.  The only complaint I have is that their mini-bar is outfitted with a weight sensor, so if you even pick up something from the bar and place it back down, they'll charge you.  The internet cable is also such that if you just plug it in, they'll charge you.  Those seem like customer gouging tactics to me, even if they did inform me at check in.  Oh yeah, and location pretty much can't be beat.  Approximately across from Caesar's and Mirage, and close to the Venetian.

      Definitely one of the few hold-overs from Vegas' early days, Harrah's accommodations exude a chintziness on par with, er, say, Reno as a whole.  BUT, you get Vegas play at Reno prices... so...  The Room.  Barest of necessities. Don't bother unpacking, awash in tan and eggshell blah, the feel of the room really exemplifies the idea that you probably won't be spending much time in it.  The other amenities cater to your basic needs. -  First there's the bed.  A strange non-conforming size/dimension that looked like a queen in width, but seemed a bit short in length; I'm only 5'5", anyone taller than me and I'm sure you're footsies would be hanging over the edge... -  The Bathroom is vanity free, simply a counter, sink, mirror, throne, and curtained bath/shower. -  There is also a TeeVee in the room, atop a television cabinet/dresser. -  And that d@rned mini-fridge stocked with junkfood and liquor.  The type of looming temptation and convenience that is guarded by a little sign that reads "Items Removed will be AUTOMATICALLY CHARGED to your bill".  The Casino.  Old timey gaudiness. The gambling at Harrah's is unglamorous gambling for gambling sake.  No Aristocrats with slinky dressed arm candy, no tie-n-slack'd young entrepreneurs whittling away at their venture capitol, no starlets or athletes.  Just gamblers.  Daphne, you cold-hearted, unyielding, never-crack-a-smile yotch of a dealer!!  The table was hot!!  The six of us were on a rhythm, boisterous, drunk, having fun!  Then you came along and droughted us!  I was up $80 when I lost 10 hands to you.  WHO THE *EFF* LOSES 10 PAI-GOW HANDS IN A ROW?!  You and your black magic!  D@RN YOU! __________________________ Five engineers and a lab tech with a penchant for MacGuyver and Indiana Jones can defeat the mini-fridge... but we've got nothing on Daphne, the 7-card fun killa!

      The hotel itself is not 4 stars, but the value is. I have gotten rates as low as $50 and just for location alone its worth it! Not to mention that the casino is not half bad, easy to navigate from/to your room &amp; they have Carnival Court (an awesome and fun outside bar)  You can't go this cheap on the Strip anymore, maybe Sahara &amp; Strat but they are waaaaay on the North side, can't walk it to the fun stuff on heels or in the heat all day... Also maybe you can get these kind of deals from Imperial Palace but that place sucks big time, the smell, its dark, cheesy and just boring.

      I know what you're thinking. 5 stars for Harrahs?? Are you on the pipe muthafucker. That answer is yes but it still doesn't deter me from dropping 5 stars on Harrahs. I can stay at Harrahs anytime for $48.00 a night because of my brothers employee discount. Last visit to Harrahs was in March and we stayed 5 days in a really clean, nice, well equipped two room suite with a frickin beautiful view for $267.00. Harrahs has been a fixture in Vegas since almost the very beginning and it seems to stick to it's old school roots in which it was born. Of all the places I can choose to stay in Vegas on the cheap there's no place like Harrahs. Their is something to be said for unloading the previous days buffet while smoking a cigarette and catching ESPN Sportscenter while deciding whether the day is going to involve gambling, drinking, or both. Word to the wise: If you want a challenging card game you will get it at Harrahs. Those old timers are no joke. Thanks for the poker lesson gentlemen.

      the rooms at Harrah's were so much nicer than I had been expecting.  they were also relatively inexpensive for a central strip location.  the gambling isn't great, and neither is the in-house entertainment... but that's what the other 3457435 casinos are for.
