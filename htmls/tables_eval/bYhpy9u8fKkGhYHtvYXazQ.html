      Great ambience!  I especially like that they hire someone to deliver fresh-baked bread via bicycle along the cobblestone "streets" --  I want that job!  Yummy pastries at the boulangerie, but there can be a line.

      Pleasurable stay with decent facilities.  Serene casino vibe with the clouds on the ceiling.   And I know everyone knows "the best" buffet, but Paris' dinner buffet is the best dinner I've had in Vegas...EVER!

      This casino was old the day it opened. This casino offers none of the aesthetics of paris and the only resemblance it really carries inside is the cheesey cafes and french stores. No one does anything here except walk through or park.

      It's fun enough.  I think since the last time I was here they painted the rooftop to lok like the sky which 4 years ago seemd like only the Venetian looked like that.  Looking for that parisian experience I asked for a crepe and imagined walking with it until I saw they served it on a plate and covered it in sauce.  So much for the french fast food!   My Latina looking clerk greeted me in french and when I ordered in french she just looked down, they when I apologized in spanish she looked up with a smile and conducted the rest of our conversation in english.  It was my most human moment in the casinos to date.

      It has a lovely sky-coloured ceiling that sometimes seems to move, and the floors are decked out like cobblestone roads.  It's a pretty casino but I didn't exactly have a religious experience - there are more compelling ones.

      Ehh, what can I say? Paris is boring. Nothing really special. Just a nice walkthrough casino for air conditioning, so you don't have to walk outside in the blazing heat. Oh and it's also pretty to take pictures of.

      Valet is not exactly the smoothest process in the world here, but it could be worse.  Overall though, we've always enjoyed our stays here since we've lucked out each time we've checked in early and received a larger corner room in return (definitely ask for it when checking in).  Room service has fairly good burgers, but the fries are what seal the deal.  :)  Of course, the crepes are delish!  It's a good place to stay, but if you have a larger budget...go to the Wynn.  ;)

      like the aladdin, Paris has a wonderful decor and fun atmosphere. the Eiffel Tower is so amazing at night... but makes makes you want to visit the real one. clubbing there is pretty interesting. they have patios, cool bathrooms, but the dancing area/bar is so crammed and congested... i wanted to leave immediately. it's too small to pack in so many Asian clubbers. lol.

      Nothing is classier than sipping cheap booze out of a giant plastic balloon with the word "Paris" blaring in hot pink...  I really like the ambience here. It's nowhere as awesome as Venetian, but it's still better than most hotels. It has a real nice rustic feel, as if someone, in their unholiness, injected Provence into the sleaziest city in the world.  I had a $7 crepe with almond paste in it and it was as delicious as a duck in a vat of fat (in Paris, we say "confit..."). It really was the best crepe I've ever had, and I've had the best that inauthentic crepe places can make. The staff had French accents, and that ain't bad.

      This place is much better than the phoney looking Venetian. The art designers here really did a top notch job. From the lighting to the perpetual twilight, if you like big themed casinos, this is your place.  My only beef is that everything's way too pricey here. 7$ for a drink is pushing it.

      The La Femme show is perfect.  I was expecting the worst and ended up amazed.  This show is more than just naked ladies--it's very artistic and the dancers are outrageously talented (and perfect).  I felt like a total cow after watching 100 perfectly lithe women traipse around for an hour, but I'm glad that I saw it.

      I enjoyed the Paris, but I find it to be quite overpriced.  I would easily give it 4 stars if it were less for the cost.    The rooms were pretty standard, but the real star of Paris is the buffett.  The gaming floor is also large and easy to navigate.

      I was pleased with the Paris experience, although I must admit we used it more as a launching pad than the main hangout.  In that role, Paris might win supreme.    Food?  I had a pain du chocolate from the cafe downstairs.  It was good.  I had a reuben from the St. Louis cafe.  It was acceptable (had to ask for the dressing, corned beef was a little tough), but the fries were great.  No special points for food from me.  Room?  I slept in it.  I could shower.  Good enough.  The thing I liked about Paris was its walking proximity to places I wanted to go to hang out and do things (Caesars, Aladdin, Harrahs, etc.) and the fact that Paris isn't very popular.  Why is that great?  Because when you're heading back to the hotel at midnight or 1am on a Friday or Saturday night and you want to catch a nightcap or two in the hotel lounge, you can actually get a seat.  In the past when trying something like that at the Bellagio or other popular places, you just can't, the places are packed and you have to stand.  Nothing kills a buzz more than sore feet.  Beware the taxi-fetcher guys, though.  Now, I understand it's a full service kind of thing, but I have a hard time tipping a guy that asks me where I'm going and tells that to the cab driver.  If he's loading my bags, fine, but only saying something to a cab driver?  Piss off.   Apparently this Paris taxi-fetcher felt he should say something about the lack of tip because after getting in the cab he held the door and said, "I hope you appreciated the service," and slammed the door.  The more I think about it, the more annoyed it makes me.  This started as a 5-star review, but based on my annoyance typing this out I have to ding it a star for that.

      I really wanted to give Paris 5 stars, I swear.  But........there were just too many little problems for it to warrant that extra star.  it's a beautiful property and in a PRIME location.  There's some fab food on site.  The crepes are orgasmic!  The decor was wonderful, and I had a view of the light show at the Bellagio.  Now for the not so nice.... 1.  There was a strange smell emanating from my bathroom.....maintenance came and dealt with it.  It seems that when you have a hotel this large, sometimes the pipes don't drain well.....This kind of weirded me out, but his magic potion did reduce the smell.  They were so packed, that there was no other equivalent room i could move to that week.  2.  I couldn't use my laptop and have a light on at the same time.  I had to call SEVERAL times to get a power cord brought to my room.  3.  I tried to print my southwest boarding card and the biz center was totally unhelpful.  4.  The pool suck-diddly-ucks for Vegas.  It was round.  There's only one.  If you want some pool time, don't stay here.

      I have a lot of nice things to say about this place, starting with the painted blue sky with clouds on the ceiling. It lightens it up a bit, so it's not as dark and drab as a lot of casinos seem to be.  The restaurants in Paris Las Vegas are generally quite good. The rooms are attractive, clean, and fairly spacious. The monster Eiffel Tower drinks last forever.  In general, the vibe here is young and friendly. People are here to have a good time. Definitely one of the better (and yet reasonably-priced) places to stay.

      No shortage of places to stay here in Vegas, that's for sure.  I stay here once a year because one of the insurance companies I work with pays for it during a conference.  I'm not thrilled.  There is NO place to go for breakfast in here, I mean there is, but not if you want a regular meal.  The layout of the place confuses me even when sober.  Bottom line is, I get tired of the French munbo jumbo...and they aren't a member of the Players club!

      This is my favorite hotel in Vegas.  Maybe I'm sucker for their theme (which is executed beautifully), but the rooms were amazing, always clean, and the service is wonderful.  The Casino floors don't even feel smoky, and the lobby ceilings are beautiful.  From the "street" performers to the little details, Paris is by far my favorite hotel...anywhere.  Make sure you check out the club and the prime rib.  It's amazing.

      I very much liked their rooms.  They were very comfortable and spacious.  Very soothing tones.

      We stayed here last year and I was not all that impressed.  I couldn't get past the kitchy decor, the rooms were small and the casino floor was too surreal for me.  Something about the lighting, but remember, I really hate the theme crap, so YMMV.    Btw, if I never see another "cobblestone" street again it'll be too soon.  You ever try to walk in high heels on that shit?  Keerist.  I'm gonna break an ankle.    I didn't check out the shops, so the only redeeming quality was that the slots are looser than most.   They took away my favorite slot though.  Boo.     My friend and I were staying at Bellagio on our more recent trip, but we walked over to Paris for a visit.   After playing for a while, we stopped to have a bite in the wee hours at the 24 hour cafe.  (Le Cafe St. Louis) This turned out to be a real pain the ass.    First of all, the food was mediocre but to add insult to injury... when I asked for bread to go with my soup I was met with an argument that they didn't have any. When I pointed out that my friend was eating a French dip sandwich so how is it that they didn't have any bread...   I was told that it was only used for sandwiches.... then after I said "Dude.  Come on.  It's just bread." he finally gave me some but told me to keep quiet about it.  Cheap asses... WTF?   It's bread.  Everyone gives complimentary bread.  What's wrong with you?    Oh, and then the bread, a hunk of baguette, turned out to be hard and tasteless.   Poseurs.    Kudos to the bartender for being cool and comping us a couple drinks though.  That was nice of him.   The only redeeming quality of the night.  Would I go back?  Maybe... but only for the bar and a few games.
