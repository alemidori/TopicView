      I've never stayed at the Treasure Island, but we've spent some time ogling the pirate show ("Sirens of T.I.") that happens few times an hour at night.  Every time the show starts, pedestrians stop dead in their tracks to see it, so it can be annoying if you're just passing through.  The show itself is only fun if you're a child or if you're tipsy.  There are some scantily clad women, muscular men, and Spears/Aguilera/Destiny style music sung on headphone mics with a lot of booty shaking.  We were bummed that the pirates were such sissies.  The Treasure Island itself has a Canter's Fairfax (of Los Angeles) outpost on the ground floor.  Its decor is crazy Jetsons style, but the food is comparable to the original Canter's deli.  It's hard to find good, homely food in Vegas, but Canter's serves up no-nonsense pastrami sandwiches and matzo ball soup.  The security staff at Treasure Island is a bunch of unfriendly goons, though.  I was tired and forgot my purse at the deli, which was turned into security.  When I went to retrieve it, I found a security guard looking through my belongings, and when I told him that was my purse, he yelled at me to stand back.  After a few minutes, he finally shoved everything back in, gave me back the purse, made me sign something but didn't give me a copy of the paperwork.

      I haven't been to "TI" (sigh) since they've gotten rid of the pirates, but it used to be a pretty hip casino with full-strength free cocktails and a lovely skull decor.  I'll post an update the next time I get a chance to check it out.

      Less pirates, means less stars. I don't know why the yahoos that manage this place don't capitalize on the popularity of pirates that Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom have brought to the mainstream.   The rooms at Treasure Island are about average for a strip casino/hotel.  If you want a nicer room, go to the Hard Rock, Bellagio or Wynn.  We did have the bonus of a room that looked out over the Sirens show, which was kinda neat.  Perhaps my favorite place in this casino is in Kahunaville, a cheesy themed bar/restaurant.  Note that I said the place was IN Kahunaville.  That place is the oxygen bar off to the side of the entrance.  It seemed a little fruity at first (that's an unfortunate pun, by the way... the O2 is scented) but when we learned that it's a GREAT hangover cure we were hooked.  I mean, who doesn't need a hangover cure in vegas?  (Hint: If you don't, then you aren't doing it right.)

      I stayed here for my bachelorette weekend in July 2005, post-remodel (and post-makeover).  As my bridesmaid who organized put, it was the cheapest "nice" hotel available for the weekend.  The rooms are decent, beds are comfortable, the pool area is quite large, and the location on the Strip is pretty good.  We went to Tangerine (the club inside) the first night after arriving at 1:30am and it packed full of sketchy people, including a "big in Europe" popstar and his manager.  highly amusing.

      This is where the young asian hipsters sorta ended up hanging out... I don't know why. It just works that way. Also, they recently added a pretty cool club... plus, i think they have the best casino car in las vegas not called the hard rock.

      Now that the wonderful PIrate battle has been replaced with the  idiotic VIxens or Sirens or Sluts of TI,there is little to recommend  this hotel. No great restaurants and guest rooms are very ordinary and overpriced. Check out the clubs,but stay and gamble elsewhere.

      I enjoyed my weekend at TI. Good location, reasonably priced, and decent rooms. I mean honestly how often are you even in your room?The customer service is certainly not that of the Ritz Carlton, but this is no motel 6. We didn't spend a lot of time in the casino, or at the restaurants or bars, but for a place to sleep it treated me right!

      not terrible but definitely not fabulous. if you have kids, this would be a decent place to go as they are pretty laid back about the little munchkins playing hide and go seek in between the slot machines. compared to the surrounding hotels, treasure island definitely had an overabundance of families. with regards to the rooms, they werent half bad. decor is slightly older and the fascade of the building looks like it hadn't been redone in a while but it was reliable. they had great shampoos and conditioners that smelled all citrusy. i really liked that. oh and the shower pressure was pretty nice. always a bonus. the pool is pretty small and always crowded with kids in floaties and scary looking people that looked like they enjoyed eating at "Dishes" buffet. the price was decent as well, just remember to flash your AAA card to get those extra discounts.  let's hope the new "TI" brand catches on and they get some more money to spruce up the place.

      i love the machines here. really, i do. gambling here is awesome and i actually WIN. never a big loss. i come here the most latenight w/ friends and gamble the night away. the club "myst" is a cool vibe and service in the casino is always good. as for the hotel itself, i wouldn't know... but i come here for the gambling, drinking (for decent prices), and chilling w/ friends. it's not soo "plush and high society-like" it's more calm and comfortable.

      "Sirens of T.I." worked in that I heard music and was led to my death.  It's quite literally the dumbest thing I've ever seen. This is typical, tacky Las Vegas humor and performance. Some guy in the audience was actually laughing at all the "jokes." Sad... Whoever received payment for writing those songs is laughing his ass off on a beach somewhere. The best part of the show was when a palm tree caught fire and their hose was too short to put it out. Now, I'd stand in a crowd to watch that...   Didn't stay in the hotel, but have been around the place a lot. They should capitalize on the Pirates of the Caribbean craze and up the ante. The ambience is lacking. I heard the buffet is good and wouldn't mind trying it.  I gave 3 stars because the hotel is still pretty cool. Sirens gets negative quintillion points for being lamer than rubber poop.

      I have stayed in the regular rooms $70-80 and the Petit Suite...love  the Petite Suite,  got a great deal at $125 a night online sales, you are getting a sitting area and the piece de resistance, the two separate marble bathrooms.  The hers bathroom is impressive, a two person jacuzzi tub in the center of the bathroom.  Plenty of room to move around the tub both inside and out.  The his bathroom is standard.  The colors are golds and beiges, very nice and luxurious.  Inside the casino, they must pump through aromatherapy through the AC, smells clean and floral, no smoky smell.  I like this hotel because it is nice and the middle of the strip.

      TI is still my second favorite hotel in LV.  Right behind The Venetian.  The service is great and you can still get wonderfully decorated and clean rooms for a good price.  The other stuff like shows, etc do not really do anything for me as the other reviewers.  I go for service, price and value.  And TI has all three!

      I stayed here for my 21st birthday. It was nice, the "show" outside of the hotel is cool...but its not my favorite place on the strip to stay at or gamble. Don't get me wrong the decor is nice, the gambling is cool...but I have had more fun elsewhere. They do serve Jim Beam and yes I had some.

      What are your expectations of a Vegas hotel?  Mine are: (1) clean, comfortable room; (2) cheap; (3) centrally located; and (4) good pool to find a place for a nap after staying up all night.  TI has it all now.  The rooms no longer have that "Arrrgh" pirate motif, but are pleasantly neutral in their decor.  The pool is on the small side, but is a decent scene--do yourself a favor and spend $200 on a cabana; you will not regret it.  And the location is good, too, certainly within walking distance of a lot of the attractions.  Oh, and this was the only casino where I won on my last trip.

      TI gets the earned "Death 1 Star".  What a  formerly nice place ruined by the new owners. How is this Treasure Island at the Mirage?  Excuse me! No one moved the hotel.  It is Treasure Island. You know, the one that had the cute pirate show battle.  One of my favorites.  So, they take a successul show and replace it with Sirens?  One of the worst and dumbest shows on the Strip. Hey, TI guys/gals.  You been in the sun too long?

      The Casino is dark and not particularly pleasant to be in.  Seems like heavy smoke all the time. Guess winning money is just as important as killing your customers with second hand smoke. Wow. You'd think Las Vegas is immune to second hand smoke (I know its not just TI, but some of the other properties seem to get fresh air in better).

      Food at the coffe shop is mediocre at best, and the fabulous steak house was way overpriced and overblown.  Oh, and the really hip night club, called Tangerine (all the 100s of ads seem to indicate that is where all the hip guys and gals congregate) is a monument to stupidit.?  Somehow if you are a guest, you can bypass the $30 cover charge. I went in at 11pm just to see what's up.  All I saw was a few scantilly clad girl bartenders, and a bunch of big South Pacific burly men in tuxes. Guess it gets rough later on. What a joke.

      Used to stay here before I could legally drink alcohol (pre 2003) and also while I was vacationing with the parents.  Good times--hang out by the pool and drink ... or drink virgin cocktails.  Mosey about the nearby pool bar or run inside to get a bite to eat.    Unfortunately they changed the whole Treasure Island thing into the new TI--whatever the heck that's about.  I haven't been there since, but I can still see that they didn't change the actual building. So how does this make sense, guys?

      Ahhh... TI, i remember this was THE place to dump your kids at on the strip years ago, since they had a pretty large arcade to babysit them while the parental units wanted to gamble. I remember playing in the arcade when i was a kid here. nowadays, my money doesn't go towards these cheap little red tickets to trade in for toys. we checked in late on a saturday, around 6pm, and since i had reserved a non smoking room and they were out, they upgraded us up to a "room in the penthouse floor with of the strip" ~according to the check in guy. When we got up there, the room was fabulous. bathroom was nice and large and our view of the strip was the pit across where venetian was expanding their shopping area. Not too bad... the cool thing was that we watched the sirens show from up there and go to see the pseudo fireworks fly towards us. that was neat. otherwise the beds were comfortable, everything was great. the pool was on the small side but we got to lay out and tan. didn't do much in ti though, it was seriosly a shit shower and shave place for us. it was conveniently located within walking distance to wynn and fashion show!

      I went here in 05' for a "girls getaway weekend".  Rooms were nice (we had the double queen bed rooms) and the bathrooms were clean.  Nice hotel.  Not bad for the price.  Nice pool and service at the pool.  The spa here was nice and my massage was great so I decided to take another trip here the next year just for the spa alone. Nice steam rooms, great jacuzzi in the women's section.  They served cucumber water and it was very relaxing...HOWEVER on the 2nd visit to the spa my massuse talked my ear off and that is something that he SHOULD not have done.  I didn't walk out feeling relaxed, but only thinking about the book he told me he was going to write about health stuff...

      I have stayed at most of the Vegas strip hotels and here are my thoughts.  What's nice about this hotel is that it is near the Wynn Hotel and Mirage.  Over the years it has undergone a few renovations to move the interior decor away from the pirate theme.  The rooms are pretty standard for a hotel on the strip.  Nothing special.  One complaint that I do have is that the beds were the worst ones that I have slept in on the strip and makes you want to go and get a massage!  TIP: If you want to check out the Tangerine Night Club, go to the cashier kiosk or even the gift shop where you can pick up free VIP passes.

      Ugh. How do you spell DEPRESSING? Well, you abbreviate it, anyway, with the letters: T.I. as it's called on the strip.  Don't go here. It's gross. Everyone's a slobbering mess.   The dealer tried to take my bet in blackjack. That shit was a push. She realized her mistake and tried to pretend nothing happened. Wow.  If these were the golden days of vegas, I know just how I woulda dealt with her...A nice knuckle sandwich in the "back room."
