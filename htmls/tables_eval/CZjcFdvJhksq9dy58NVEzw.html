      I share the opinion of numerous others who have commented on this buffet under the Bellagio hotel listing, that this is in fact, the best of the Vegas buffet world.  Once again, make sure to arrive just before the change over to lunch or dinner, to get a shot at dishes from two services.

      There isn't anything like a Las Vegas ultra-buffet. The King of Buffets is definitely at the Bellagio. You can get a thick, juicy steak grilled to order with your crab legs and I can't even begin to describe what its like when you come here. I think, if you don't know then you'll just have to find out. The price-tag looks steep on the surface but once you try it you realize thats its such a bargain and you end up like me... How do they make a profit? Oh yeah, gambling.

      Pretty damn good buffet. I've done the breakfast/lunch one. If only there were an easier way to say that...hmm... Anyway, the food is good, if nearly completely meat based. They tend to have fairly exotic meats, such as wild boar or heritage turkeys. Definitely a plus. The only problem for me is that their salads were uniformly piss poor. Especially their Asian-style salads; wow, downright inedible. Other than that though one of the best buffets in Vegas; definitely a battle between Paris and Bellagio.

      Thank goodness I fled the streets of Paris to head over to this buffet!  It was soooooo good.  At a buffet I'm a sampler, and if I can't control the portions I just go for a taste.   I recall that the couple to my side was absolutely appalled that I picked up about 5 desserts.  Well, not so much appalled but absolutely jealous that I exhibited no shame for my total commitment to pigging out ...he,he,he.  Bastards!  I was appalled that no one else left a tip for the servers.

      Bellagio and Wynn are the best buffets in town. They're also the  priciest,but worth every cent. If you've tried some of the other places, Bellagio will surprise you with its quality and variety. Concentrate on the expensive items,like the smoked salmon,don't waste room on pizza or salad that you can eat anywhere. If you're confused by the  selection try a small sample of each item,then on the next pass you'll know which dishes to take. Most buffets have only a small number  of really good things,so when there is this much selection it makes sense to plan ahead. Keep in mind that Bellagio DOES NOT have any good desserts,besides the fresh fruit,so don't worry about saving room,you won't need it. One last note: plan on tipping at least 20%, or probably more. The service is that good.

      One of the best buffets in Vegas, the only thing keeping it from getting 5 stars is that it specializes in breadth instead of depth.  You can find almost any kind of cuisine here, but only a few selections of each.  My favorite of all buffets would be Paris, where you only find parisian food, but damn is it good.

      Out of all the buffets I've had in my life (there were quite a few...considering I grew up in Reno), this one is most definitely the best.  Although, that might be attributed to the fact that I tend to sample different foods as opposed to "stuff myself silly" at buffets now.  Regardless, the quality of food is great and is only surpassed by the variety of desserts that are offered.  My personal favorite that they offer is the mini belgian waffle.  YUM.  I can't get enough of those.  The cocktails available are equally as tasty!

      I was a little hesitant to try the Buffet at Bellagio...can't say I've had great experiences concerning buffet lines.  But this one in particular is wonderful.  Yes, it is expensive, but the buffet offers copious amounts of delicious food.  On my first round, I chose shrimp cocktail, spicy tuna rolls, baked sea bass, and miso soup.  I arranged everything artistically on the plate and proceeded to dine.  Let me tell you, the shrimp cocktail was delicious!  The spicy tuna rolls were satisfactory.  I was pleasantly surprised by the sea bass.  The miso soup tasted a little bland, though.  On my next round, I tried the different pasta dishes, shrimp cocktail (again), and salmon.  I liked everything on my plate this time.  The desserts were too sweet.  I tried to fried bananas in caramel sauce...at least that's what I think it was.  They were good, but just started to get too sweet.  The buffet is a great way to fill up without breaking your bank at other more expensive establishments.  And I think it's worth your money for an extremely satisfying meal.

      My friends and I managed to rack up a fair amount of comp points from the MGM and got to eat here pretty much for our entire trip.  What a spread!  Their offerings include king crab, juicy steaks, fresh bass, and what could be one of the best bread puddings I've ever had (I've only found 2 other places in my travels that have it this good).  I COMPLETELY understand why there's always a line out the door for their buffet.  Truely the gold standard in buffets and an absolute can't miss whenever you're in Vegas.

      Very yummy and more options that you can handle. You probably want to fast a bit before hitting this big ol' buffet. $$$$ Kinda expensive but if you gamble you can usually get it comped.

      me and my boys chose two buffets to go to this past trip and I said the Bellagio had to be one of them. It was great! the prime rib was most def the best out of all buffets and rivaled most of those found in steak houses. the pesto mashed potatoes was a treat and the sushi bar was a nice surprise. Beware of the ahi and salmon poke, a lil bit too spicy. There was a lil bit of a line but who cares, once you get to the table you can be eating within 10 min tops!  O and for those complaining about the price. Our tab ended up being like 35 per person with tip for dinner. Not bad considering that our breakfast at the Luxor cafe was 30 each with average fare. I'd pay the extra 5 bucks for the gourmet buffet anyday.

      I've been to Vegas twice, and each time we go to the Bellagio for the buffet. I don't think it's a secret that this is the creme de la creme in the world of vegas buffets, which is the only drawback. what might be a secret is how to optimize your food consumption while doing your thang at the buffet. I've heard various strategies. I don't believe in the "don't eat before" strategy, I'm of the "slow and steady" philosophy. I'm also going to start watching the Hot Dog eating contest on ESPN (like I did my most recent visit) to psych myself up for excessive self-gorging.  The food ranges from really good to really bad, depending on what you get. I don't know if there are any guidelines, you're just gonna have to try a bit of everything. but don't fill up on carbs, go for the meats and get your money's worth.

      The wait to get into this buffet was testing (over an hour) but once we were in, it was no holds barred. I skipped the Chinese food (didn't look much better than what I'd get at home) and loaded up on the seafood. I counted no less than five different fish dishes, in addition to the Alaskan king crab legs, and the sushi. The sushi was surprisingly quite good -- they also had a variety of other seafood/ocean dishes, like Japanese wakame salad and ceviche.  They also had Kobe beef and filet mignon and all kinds of other cuts of meat -- my guy commented that these weren't as good as the seafood, though. There was a wide selection of desserts, which we nibbled a little bit here and a little bit there at.  Just going here for the sheer spectacle of the buffet is worth the price tag.

      I agree with many on yelp, this is a high end buffet, you can even tell by the presentation of items, many items given in single serve size plates, bowls, etc...lunch $19 and dinner $27.  Went for a late breakfast and didn't have to wait in line.

      I love this buffet.  It takes forever to get through the line, but it's so worth it.  The whole dining experience is very comfortable.  The tables and seats are nice and the waiters are very attentive.  I love the huge variety of seafood!  I've heard that the breakfast buffet is amazing, I hope that I can try that soon.

      Why do people wait in hour long lines for a buffet? I guess it's Vegas. We had passes to avoid the wait, and figured why not gorge ourselves a little.  For a buffet, it was fairly impressive. The sushi alone propels the Bellagio above most Vegas buffets I've heard about. But it is still a buffet. You won't spot George Clooney eating here.

      Holy crap! This is the best buffet created. Ever. I despise Vegas, but when I have to be there I visit the Bellagio buffet. And for those 2-4 hours, I love the city. It's an escape, and a decadent food orgy. I'm not talking about your run-of-the-mill-all-you-can-eat pasta, salad and cupcakes. I'm talking a variety of fresh fish, filet mignon, Alaskan King crab, gourmet desserts, etc. etc. All you can stuff! It's like a food hedon haven. I swear I talk about this place to this day. And when I'm there I drag everyone to go there. It's a steep $37, but well worth it. My mouth is salivating on my keyboard as I type. Love it, go there.

      All buffets should be modeled after this one.  We had about 3 hours to kill before leaving for the airport, so we decided to slowly eat lunch.  One little plate here, one little plate there.... you get the picture.  Well.... there is so much to choose from .... and EVERYTHING is good.  Totally worth the wait.

      The Buffet at Bellagio is one of the best buffet in LV. They have sooo much food to choose from and each of them are delicately prepared. Their kobe beef, though i doubt if its the real one, is really good. King crabs are cut in have so its easier to work with. Sashimi are fresh. And their dessert, there is sooo much to choose from and taste really good. I would definitely come back here if i have the money.

      i don't consider standing in line for a buffet the pinacle of a civilised life but this is a great buffet.  i think buffets are bad-- you eat more than you normally would because it is "all you can eat" v. "all that you should eat"  the food was amazingly delicious and i ate way more than i should have.  the champagne--rather their sparkling was out of place--it was a not very nice bottle of California sparkling-- if no one else noticed i did.

      To me, this remains one of the best buffet restaurants and I am always attracted to return there. I love the atmosphere- the nicely designed friendly interior... Yesterday we had the Champagne Brunch... umm, well, not really a champagne, but rather, a higher-end Freixenet brut... Still, a very good value- especially with the free refills. $35 per person including the tip. And so we sat there in style, and pigged out royally!

      After missing the dinner buffet on a Saturday night due to the long line, we made it to the Sunday brunch buffet.  The trick about catching this buffet is that you get there late enough to enjoy the brunch foods, but stay long enough to enjoy the dinner foods too.  For example, my dining companion had her eyes peeled for the crab legs.  When they finally arrived at the very end of our long long meal, she made room in her stomach for the crab.  The poke and sashimi stuff started coming out later on too, and I gorged on that as well.  (It's not exactly the highest quality, but it'll do.)  Overall, buffets are what you make of them.  You overeat and you overeat more.  The good thing about this buffet is the huge selection of food and you're bound to find at least a few things you like.  Everyone in your party is bound to be happy, and that's the good thing.    The question always remains though, did I eat my money's worth?  And sometimes you do, and sometimes you don't.  I try not to do the buffet thing anymore.  I don't think I'm getting my money's worth.  I think I rather pay more for quality than quantity.  Update: 04/24/07 - Last Friday I tried doing the Bellagio buffet again.  This time we went at 3:30, just in time to pay the lunch price ($19.95) but see the dinner goodies come out at 4 pm.  Dinner goodies include king crab legs, prime rib, kobe beef, etc.  Other honorable mentions include rack of lamb, creme brulee, caramel flan, chocolate-covered strawberries, shrimp cocktail, ceviche, and poke.   Sadly, I'm an embarrassment when it comes down to buffets.  I know that I definitely didn't get my money's worth at all.  We stayed there for at least two hours and I could even eat twenty dollars worth!  I'll have to say no the next time I'm invited!
