      outstanding hotel. we had a really amazing suite...the bathroom was the size of a small apartment and you can do laps in the bath. vegas is already a great time in itself, but staying here made it that much better. especially when you've been up for 2 days and you really need an extra comfy bed to collapse in.

      Fantastic hotel, I've had the luxury of only staying here in suites, and for bachelor parties and weekend-long benders, but I felt that everyone in the hotel and casino was friendly and attentive, regardless of my mental condition.

      My favorite luxury hotel in LV. The Venetian does an excellent job of making you feel somewhat normal after three nights of manic mayhem. You can't but feel respectable as you nod your head to the doorman, wave your room card, hold your head high to stop it from wobbling and walk straight back to the pool for some more bloody marys and margaritas. Then you can take part in some water aerobics with the other early birds.

      i love staying at this all-suite hotel. i think their claim to fame is that they have the highest average square footage for their rooms. i think their sleeping rooms are better than the bellagio - which is a comparable price. the venetian has great places to eat, shop, and be merry. if you have time, check out the canyon ranch spa, jimmy choo, and one of the yummy italian places in "st mark's square".

      Really pretty casino and nice place to hang out.  We spent a lot of time in the food court, even if we were staying somewhere else.  They have a good sandwich place that makes a fresh panini and a ginormous gelato stand with about 40 different kinds of frozen goodness.  We also ate at the Asian fusion restaurant that was upstairs.  There was a lot of sake involved, but I think I recall the food as being tasty.  The gondola rides seem a bit like getting paddled around a mall, but it could be fun, I guess.

      When I saw a great deal on the internet for a room at the Venetian, I pounced on it!  I had heard so many great things about this all-suite hotel that I just had to stay there.  This place is huge, one of the largest resort/casinos in Vegas. It is themed so nicely. The shopping plaza with the canals is so charming. With all the shops &amp; restaurants in this hotel you have no reason to ever step outside. ;)  Our room was extrordinary. The bathroom alone is bigger than most NYC hotel rooms. There is a glassed in shower, a large soaking tub, double sinks, a vanity table and a seperate water closet with its own phone. The room had 2 TVs, one in the bed area and one in the seating area which was a couple of steps below the sleeping area.   I highly recommend a stay at The Venetian!

      Have stayed here a number of times for weddings, business and pleasure. The hotel is made up entirely of suites, and the base grade of suites is already very plush. Each has its own little living room and the sleeping areas are very divided from the main parts of the suite.

      This place is gorgeous. I wish I got to stay here all week! Be sure to call day-of and see if they have a better rate. I paid only $169. I don't know what they spray around the casino, but it smells pretty good. The people in traditional Venetian costumes are a nice touch. One day, when I get my own palace, I'm going to decorate it like the Venetian.

      Huge, impressive.  More than 4K rooms, each has 3 phones, 2 TVS (not plasma), bath AND glassed shower, separate WC, vanity counter, 2 sinks, a fax / printer, table, couch, desk, Internet.  There are enough people spending money here to support good shops and restaurants -- never had a bad meal here even in the food court.   The feel is glitz, power, new money.  But the size creates log jams, service that is professional on the strength of rules and systems but not personal attentiveness or courtesy.  Check-in and taxi lines can be an hour each.  They deliver room keys and shaving lotion, Fedex packages to your room, but not tylenol no matter how sick you are.  You get around all obstacles with some ingenuity and generous tipping, if you are a girl you can try crying but that gets tiring.  Venezia concierge level is a world apart, a hotel within a hotel atop a parking garage.  Here there is no gambling, just a garden.  You get checkin, dinner reservations, VIP passes, anything else you ask, seated before a desk.  Staff remembers your name one day to another.  There are four receptions a day in the small lounge with food and an open bar, newspapers, a DVD library.  Bath liquids are better.  All that for $100 extra per day.  The frustration is that you pay extra for services any first rate hotel should give for free, noticeable only because the rest of the hotel lacks it.  All rooms are, in fact, identical throughout the property until you get to the very high end suites.  So pay $100 to be well pampered -- or save your money, do it yourself, and cry, whine, and tip.  Back down on the floor, a three or four block walk through the casino from the guest elevators, the convention area has one vast level of ballrooms atop another, escalators up five or six landings before fading to the hazy beyond.  Enough suites and ballrooms, I commented, that all the Jews in my home state Oklahoma could have weddings and bar mitzvahs on the same day they once a year in this hotel.  My convention companion thought this was funny.  "Jew day," she said.  I'm not raining on Saint Mark's square here by being first to give four stars.  I'm not saying it's the Excalibur or the Imperial Palace.  It's a good choice for Vegas, memorable.  You should try it.  But it's not Four Seasons, not St. Regis.  Not as cool as The Hotel or as fun as Mandalay Bay.

      I loved this hotel...from the spacious room, comfy pull-out bed, two tvs, awesome bathroom, decor, shopping, grand lux, tao...you really could stay in this hotel and not go anywhere else all weekend.  The staff were really nice to us, although the lines did get long due to the size of this hotel.  But everything was great.  Even the hallways smelled nice...they must pump a scent through the air system.  The only downside is that the spa is really hard to find, and getting to our room at the venezia tower was a bit of a trek, but I guess we got some exercise in!

      favorite place to stay.  the rooms are huge, and now that i'm beyond the "willing to sleep on a floor or couch" stage of my life, i really appreciate having all the extra room to relax.  the rest of the hotel is great too, although the layout is a bit weird.  won money at the craps table, so makes it that much better!

      Central location on the strip and during conferences, incredibly competent staff, and every room is a suite. I don't want a boutique hotel caught up in it's boutiquey-ness. I want a hotel that really wants to cater to my comfort, and makes me feel like they just want what's best for me. Forgive me, I had to take off a star because they charge for their gym.

      One of the finest hotels ever.  We stayed in the Venezia tower (some added ammenities) and reveled in our 750 square foot room (larger than out SF apartment!).  Rooms are well appointed with luxurious beds/bedding, lovely (and expensive)furnishings, and a bathroom to die for.  Marbe soaking tub and seperate glass enclosed shower with multiple shower heads.  Service is great..only complaint is registration.  Despite the "private" check in advertised in the Venzia tower, we waited almost 30 min for one of only two employees to help us (this was the thur before Memorial weekend- more than 2 employees please, folks). Not the wealthies of patrons, we figured out a way to go for less than premium cost.  Each suite offer two large queen beds and a double size couch pull out.  "double" occupany runs about $250/night.  Five people fit EXTREMELY comfortably into these rooms. We pulled off the Venetian for about $150/per person TOTAL for all 3 nights!!!!

      My favorite hotel in Vegas. The first to paint their ceilings with a daytime look its ben copied by many of the rest.  Ton's of mid range shopping here and extremely well designed.    The gondola rides in and outside are a supreme touch and much more affordable here then in the real Venice.

      I stayed here during the first week of December, so the hotel had a lot of rooms available. I was offered an upgrade to their penthouse suite for an additional $100 a night, but declined it because all of their rooms are suites anyhow. The woman who helped me was so sweet though, because she ended up giving us the penthouse suite upgrade for free! The suite was fabulous! It had 2 baths, huge bedroom, living room, dining room and foyer. I felt like a celeb!! I've been back since then and the suites in the Venezia tower are really nice as well - service is fantastic.

      given the size of the rooms &amp; bathroom and the fine furninshings, the venetian is my destination of choice if i have to be in vegas. service has improved over the past few years although there is still room for improvement.   the canyon ranch health club does require a fee for entry but it is huge and very plush.   if presented the option, stay in the venezia tower, closer to bouchon and a bit removed from the casino floor.

      This is a great hotel.  I just came back from a conference there and have to say that I was impressed.  The rooms (suites, actually) are ginormous, and the service was impeccable.  The conference food was decent, but not spectacular, but you really can't expect great things when trying to feed 6000 people.  The conference and ballroom areas were spacious and well tailored for our company's 5-day gathering.  My room had 3 phones, 2 TVS, a tub and  glass shower stall, separate toilet room, vanity counter, two sinks, a fax / printer, living room area with table, couch, desk, Internet.  The bars and restaurants are good, and I have to say that for some reason, the taxi and valet service were less chaotic and more speedy than any other LV I've been to.  Yes, the company paid for my $1K stay there, but I'd definitely consider going back.  The Bellagio may be a little more elegant, but I don't think you can beat the square footage and amenities.

      just from a "tourist"'s point of view...this is one of the hotels i love visiting in vegas.  their decor is amazing...from the realistic sky to the backdrop of italian boutiques.  it was photo galore!!  i definitely took many pics here.  next time, i'll stay here and maybe try the gondola ride--it looks ultra romantico!!

      Venetian is pretty amazing with their quality layout, design and housing my favorite Las Vegas restaurant, Bouchon.  The shopping area is similar to Paris and the Ceasar's Forum with the faux sky, but what sets this place apart is the indoor\outdoor gondolas rides. I really enjoyed it, although it can be a little awkward with all those damn tourists taking pictures of you while you are chillin' during your 15min ride.  It cuts into your wallet with $15 per person price tag.  Do it for your lady!

      Wow, what a let down. After everything I'd heard about this place, I was expecting to be blown away. Unfortunately, everything looks really, really cheesy here and is about as similar to Venice as getting grocery store sushi is to living in Tokyo. The whole place just saddened and underwhelmed me. Combine that with the fact that they used to have a full on tiki bar that they recently gutted to turn into an ordinary douchebag bar and I've got nothing but contempt for the over-rated Venetian.

      Wow.  They have the craziest gelato stand.  You'd swear it was a bar.  There was no line.  You just stand there (like in a bar) and try to get the attention of the next available gelato scooper (like a bartender).  People are actually shoving and arguing because "they were first".  I just had to laugh.    What I like about this place is the array of gelato flavors, and the fact that you can mix and match as you please.  The last time I visited, I had the tiramisu gelato and the mint gelato.  It was gooooooood.

      This is by far my favorite vegas hotel to stay in...especially for bachelorette groups.  This was pure pampered luxury.  We stayed in a suite in the Venezia towers. From the front door to your suite is like walking through a labyrith.  You have to go through two elevators, guarded security, and long twisted hallways.  If I were drunk going to my room, I would definitely need a designated friend to walk me to my room.    I loved the vanity area in their enormous bathroom with a bath tub, duo sinks, and a shower that fits 2.  And you know girls need space to primp.  I slepted on the sofa bed, which surprisingly confortable and felt just like a real bed.    Also since we were a group of girls and stayed at their hotel, we got VIP treatment at their club, Tao.  The concierge was able to assist us  to get us in front of the line without waiting in the guestlist or general admission line with no cover.
