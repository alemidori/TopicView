      The secret is out! This is great Pizza!  This place sells pizza by the slice or pie and has a great crispy crust.  Why do I call it the Secret Pizza Joint? Because it HAS NO NAME! It has no sign. No posted hours. When you are on the restaurant level look for a hallway with seven hundred (mostly Italian or Vegas themed) records albums on the walls and ceiling, walk down that hallway and you will find it. This is the poor mans joint in Cosmo. Slices are about $3.50 each and you can get a cup of Pabst Blue Ribbon here also! ZAZZ!!

      Stopped in for a weekday lunch. There was a small crowd when we arrived. No menus here. Slices start at $3.00 and it's 50-cents for additional toppings. A full pie is $17. Pizzas are pre-cooked, you make your selection based on what's available and it's tossed in the pizza oven for a few minutes to heat it through and crisp the crust.  We tried the pepperoni, the onions and peppers, the white pizza and the sausage and meatball. The total with two diet cokes was 22.16.  We stood at the counter and enjoyed our slices. Nicely crisp (slight char) chewy crust, light sauce and gooey cheese. The least favorite slice was the sausage and meatball -- bland meats. The favorite was the onion and pepper slice.

      Solid pizza for a very affordable price. I think I spent about $3 for a decently sized pizza slice. Buying a bottle of coke is about the same price if you walk back out to one of the Cosmopolitan stores in the mall.  Pizza tastes as good as they look. Not overly greasy, but  flavorful. Give some props to the pizza makers. They make a good pizza pie. There's some quality ingredients for what you pay for.  If you're around the Cosmopolitan and want to fill up without breaking the bank, definitely check this place out. It's hidden up in the 3rd floor through a hallway behind the pool table area.

      The secret pizza place is a lot of fun because it's on the 3rd floor next to a great set of restaurants and a pool table. To get to the good stuff, walk down a cool hallway with every square inch covered in vintage albums. Once you've made it to the ordering counter, you're presented with a cool pinball machine and many different kinds of pizzas. There are very large pizzas presented to you along with a few shiny stainless steel pizza ovens along with some peeps to help you decide on which slice to buy.  When I went the first time during the opening week of the Cosmopolitan hotel, I noticed that an authentic Italian pizza creator from a local pizza joint had switched jobs! At first I said to myself, oh no what happened. And then I thought about it. If this guy works at the secret pizza joint now, I'll be able to sample some excellent pizza more often, so I'm ok with that. The pizza creator recognized me and just handed me a slice to test out. What a guy!

      This place is ridiculous. I stopped by during a recent trip to Vegas and I was very impressed with the pizza. I had a slice of white and a slice of pepperoni. The thing I loved the most was the crust. It was quite possibly the best crust I have ever eaten, and I don't say that lightly. Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and a slight twinge resembling sourdough.   Seating is limited so we took our slices out into the foyer and sat at a large wooden table. Their also is a foosball table with glass over the top so you could potentially sit there, have your slice, and play a match or two. If you do sit outside of the place don't be surprised if people start asking you where the secret pizza place is. My response between bites of cheesy glory: "down the hallway with all the vinyls"   Two beers on tap: PBR and Dogfish Head 60 minute  Two games to play: Vegas themed pinball and Galaga.  Go find it. Now.

      A few of my friends kept raving about this pizza place inside Cosmopolitan.  Telling me I had to try it.  So in the middle of our clubbing session at Marquee we left the club to go get some pizza.  This place is hidden on the second floor in between Blue Ribbon Sushi + Jaleo.  It's hidden, if you were just walking by, you'd never know it was a pizza joint down that long hallway.  Once you reach the end of the hallway you go into this little area with a Galactica (is that how you spell it?) arcade game and a pinball machine.  The minute we walked in we were greeted by the pizza maker, Nico.  He was very personable and explained what would make a good slice.  We start off with a basic cheese slice, a pepperoni slice or a white slice and make "magic" at the end.  We told him to surprise us so he made us a white pizza w/ roasted tomatoes and basil + garlic.  Second slice was meatball w/ green peppers.  This is the BEST pizza I have ever had.  I used to love Rocco's pizza in Summerlin, but now that I've tasted this, it is ultimately the best pizza.  The price is very reasonable.  It's $3.00 and $0.50 per topping.   This is a great go to place after clubbing.  It's hard to explain how good this pizza is.  I'm not a big pizza eater, but this place makes me want to eat a whole pie.  Definitely worth a try if you're ever at the Cosmo.  Remember, it's on the second floor in between Blule Ribbon Sushi + Jaleo.

      Treasure hunt time !!   If you're cunning enough to find this place, then you definitely deserve the pizza that they serve. Lucky for you, it's not that hard to find.   Clues: Third floor of the cosmopolitan. If you see the pool table, you're getting close.  Hallway lined with album covers.   This little place only offers about five seats, but guests can grab a seat outside where the pool table is. It also has a pinball machine and an arcade game. Something to keep you busy if there is a wait.   Slices are about 3 to 4 dollars, and are decently sized. There wasn't too much sauce on it, which I fully appreciate. And the sausage was good, and had a bit of kick to it. They have a couple beers on hand. I can't remember the other one, but the one of the selections was PBR. I was disappointed by both choices, and opted out of getting the beer.   Overall, awesome place to go to if you're in the area. I just wish this wasn't tucked away on the Strip, because like most locals - I tend to stay away from the Strip and the tourists [who never seem to follow the crosswalk signs, and insist on crossing the street even if it isn't their turn].

      Hidden gem inside the Cosmo Hotel!!  Its actually called Pizzeria.  Super cheap pizza and the quality was amazing. I love thin crust pizza, it's my FAVE! They close at 4am so it's a perfect spot to hit up after the club for some yummy greasy food! I ordered the pepperoni with sausage. The sausage is different from other types of pizza. It's sliced up in bigger pieces plus the cheese just melts in your mouth!  Really small and seating can be a problem. Seems like its more of a grab and go kinda thang. Make sure to come here for some bomb pizza!! Might be kinda hard to find so ask around. If you find a tunnel you went to the right spot! :]

      There is a pizza god in Vegas! I'm from Philly and moved here to Vegas in 2006 and have missed east coast pizza ever since... Until now! If you want this pizza, you'll have to look hard for it as it is kinda sorta not advertised anywhere... Go to the 3rd floor of the Cosmo Casino/ Resort and look for the pool table/ game area and then there will be a hallway with records or some sort of "pop art" on the walls - go down that hallway! There is no sitting area, only an eat-up counter space but who cares, your going to inhale the pizza anyway! Closest thing to east coast you'll find in the city, guaranteed!

      The secret pizza place officially without a name.   Located on the 3rd level.  There isn't a sign, so look past the pool table.  This pizza joint is located down a long hallway lined with album covers.  You might be able to spot the "Vegas" pinball machine from outside.  It's a very small place.  Once inside, you will notice: -A few stools and a small counter to sit at.   -Pinball machine, and an arcade game.   -Couple of pizza ovens. -Pizza counter with pre-made pizzas, and a handful of toppings to choose from. -Pizza artist and a cashier. -Great pizza!  It's not a full dining establishment.  Pretty much order and go. You wouldn't expect much more from a place with $3 pizza slices in a multi-billion dollar resort.   You can have extra toppings added for a small charge.  If you order a slice, it is tossed into the oven for a couple minutes and you are good to go.  Full pizza's start at $17.  Guest's of the hotel can place an order through room service.   Feeling thirsty?  They have PBR  and Dogfish Ale on tap.    The people who work here are great.  Real pizza artist's with personality.    Check this place out!  It's convenient, inexpensive and open late night until after Marquee Nightclub closes.

      Possibly the cheapest meal you will find in any of the casinos on the Las Vegas Strip.  And this unassuming and "hidden" pizzeria, which is not even what their name is (according to the man I spoke to behind the counter) is located in the newest luxury casino to opened in Las Vegas.  It is on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan, across from the escalator and located next to Blue Ribbon Sushi.  There are no signs indicating that there is anything down the short hallway adorned with album covers, besides of course the pinball machine and flat screen televisions mounted on the wall clearly visible to anyone who bothered to look in.  But instead of finding a hidden alcove of arcade games, you will find a counter where you can order your pizza by the slice or by the whole pie, and work space where they prepare the NY-style pizzas from scratch.  Prices are reasonable.  Slices starts at $3 per slice (plain cheese), $3.50 (one-topping), $4 (two toppings combo), and for $6 (you get a slice of plain cheese pizza and domestic draft beer).  18" Pizza by the pie: $17 (Cheese), $18 (White Pizza - Ricotta &amp; Mozzarella Cheese), $22 (three-toppings), or $25 (five-toppings).  Available Toppings (in alphabetical): Black Olives, Extra Cheese, Fresh Garlic, Green Peppers, Meatballs, Mushrooms, Onions, Pepperoni, Ricotta, Roasted Tomatoes, Sliced Sausage, Spinach, White Anchovies.  Beverages: Coca-Cola Brand fountain drinks, beer and wine (domestic and premium draft), Illy Coffee.  The cup of soda is pretty small, but you can ask for refills. :D  Desserts: New York Cheesecake Slice and Cannoli.  Also if you are staying at the Cosmopolitan and too busy/lazy/important/lost :p to make your way to the "Pizzeria", you can ring up the hotel to have someone deliver your pizza order.  BTW, the concept of selling pizzas by the slice has been around for a long time, just ask any UCB students, but to implement this concept inside a mega luxury casino is as Misti (LV Yelp CM) stated, "genius"!  ----2/15/2011---- Holy cow!  I have no idea this place gets so packed at 11pm on a Tuesday night!  And their cheese-less pizzas with extra garlic oil added to the pizza sauce is dope!  I am glad I ate the last slice that no one else wanted, even though I was rather full already :)  Decor: 4.5/5 Pizza: 3.5/5 Price: 4.5/5 Staff: 5/5 Friendly and nice to the guests.

      Shhhhhh! can you keep a secret?    We stumbled upon a secret pizzeria in the new Cosmopolitan hotel.  It was 3 in the morning and we roll in jonesin for some food. Nico was such a sweetheart, he told us stories, listened to ours, and gave us advice on life, love, and all things worldly.

      This place is "the find" of the century as far as late night Vegas food goes.  While all the nice restaurants have closed up shop &amp; your options are Fattburger or a crummy 24hr cafe, Pizzeria is a foodie godsend that's open until 4am!  3 people, 2 slices and 1 drink each = ~$35  The pizza is wonderful, the service is even better.  Have Nico put a little magic on a white pizza for you!  The staff here loves their job &amp; it shows in the service &amp; the food.  I'm only sad that I found this on my last day in Vegas, or I would have saved myself the 3am room service bill from the night before.

      Its a pretty cool hidden spot at Cosmopolitan and Slices prices are pretty decent. However when I stopped in arround 6 on a Sunday all the slices were old and the cashier was a dick. I had the ricotta cheese slice and it was good but, I am sure it would be better if it was semi fresh. So, first impression gets a 3 star, but they will get another chance when I am in the area.

      Cheap food in a hotel/casino. Super nice employees. Pizza that is delicious. What more could you want?  I like to think of this place as a hole in the wall of The Cosmopolitan. It's not advertised, nor does it have a name. In fact, it's easy to miss if you're not looking for it. I walked by it several times (I work in The Cosmopolitan) and I never once noticed it until someone pointed it out. It's between Jaleo and Blue Ribbon, right by that weird spaceship elevator. Go down a long hallway with vintage album covers, and voila! You've reached the pizzeria with no real name. It's delicious, cheap, and great for a hangover.   The man working there was kind enough to charge me a little less for my slice. I got a slice of sausage pizza and it was awesome! The perfect ratio of cheese to sauce, not super stiff but not super soggy, just perfect.  Great place.. will DEFINITELY return for a quick bite!

      The Secret Pizza Place is its real name, I swear.  I was so amped when I found it, thanks to you previous 21 yelpers. I LOVE pizza, and I think I might have found my favorite pizza place besides Grimaldi's. Then again, I came at 3 in the morning, was given a free slice of pizza AND a free slice of cheesecake, AND great conversation so I could be a little influenced but I'm pretty sure it's excellent.  Please try the white pizza with tomatoes. Your tastebuds will thank you. Please make sure you have some gum with you. Your friends and other strangers will thank you.  Nico and Cristos are food artists. 'Artists' would have been italicized if that were allowed.  The slice of cheesecake is pretty clutch, too.  Bring tip money! You'll need it, i swear!

      I wish this place could stay a secret forever.   Had it not been for my fellow yelpers I would have never found this place. Like everyone else has said-it's down a long hallway of album covers with a pinball machine at the end thinly sandwiched between 2 other restaurants on the 3rd floor, behind the game area. If you really need anymore help, just go to the Cosmo's website and look at the building floor plans. It can be pretty hard to find.   At the end of the skinny, slightly creepy hallway, it's as if you've set foot in the type of pizza shop you see pretty much everywhere except Las Vegas.  It's $3.00 a slice, which may seem steep but by the standards of The Strip that might as well be free (The Strip is the place where bottles of water can be as high as $4.00 and the dollar menu doesn't even exist at McDonald's people).  They offer parmesan, oregano, garlic powder, red pepper flakes and pepper on the tables, which is perfect but at the same time rather unnecessary - this pizza is good enough without flavor enhancement. The crust is so good, it's burnt enough to be really crispy, but not burnt enough to just taste.....burnt. The cheese was bubbly and piping hot. My only gripe is that it was a little bit too greasy, but I'm willing to overlook that.   Two slices of pepperoni pizza and drink (with as many free refills as you want) came out to be: $10.81. Not bad at all for The Strip.  Let's hope this stays a ~*secret*~ for as long as possible, and let's hope that when it eventually stops being a secret that the owners won't see that as reason to jack up the prices. *sarcastic grin*

      This is really good and inexpensive pizza!  So I was looking for great pizza and turned to Yelp for advice and as always they were right about the Pizzeria @ The Cosmopolitan.   When you go to The Cosmopolitan there are absolutely no advertisements for this place. Some people like to search the Casino, but I cheated and ask someone that works at the hotel. (I would say the location, but that would give away all of the fun of looking for it. Read another review for the location.   By the guy's expression, you feel apart of a special club of people who know about the Pizzeria.   I had a peperoni, sausage and green pepper slice that was amazing. It is just the perfect combination of sauce, cheese, and crust.   Next time I am in the hankering for a slice, I'll come here.

      I seriously thought I was heading in to the restroom cuz I had to piss badly.  Long hall with vintage music album decoration and after walking all the way at the end, oh its a pizza joint.    This place is a hidden treasure! Thin crust pizzas, NY style, just the right amount of cheese and tomato sauce.  I bought a slice of their sausage and mushroom and ended up buying 2 more because its really that good.  It's hard to find but I believe this pizza joint is on the 4th floor.  You'll see a pool table just right outside and that's when you'll see the entrance at the corner.

      Great great pizza, and on the vegas strip it does not get better, cheaper, or more convenient!  Tucked away on the 3rd floor of the new cosmopolitan hotel, after an unmarked hallway lined with records, you get this little hole in the wall pizzeria, run by nico and staff.  let him choose your poison.... he REALLY knows what he's talking about. our group ordered a pie of cheese, and then each let him pick our individual extra slices. i got meatball, ricotta, and bell peppers. and OH MY GOD.  i usually dont like meat on pizza and bell peppers ever, but this worked magic delicious pizza heaven.

      THE best pizza EVER!  The pizza here was equally good sober or drunk! The crust is super thin while the ingredients were as fresh as they could be.  I know what you're thinking... its just pizza! But this has got to be the tastiest pizza on the west side!  I make sure I get some pizza at the Cosmo every Vegas trip!

      You know, this place is good, but....if one were to believe the reviews here, it would seem as though glorious slices of heaven were handed down from Mount Olympus by radiant angels making water from wine with flour, yeast and pepperoni as someone hands their money over the counter.  It's good....and it was fun to check in here...but it's not the BEST PIZZA EVER!!!  That said, if you're walking on the strip towards the city center and feeling a hankering for some very tasty pie, walk into this casino and look for that tube-style elevator near the back quarter of the casino floor.  It will, once one completes the journey to the 4th floor, deposit you mere feet from the unmarked entrance of this really nifty find.  I wonder, given the success the whole lets-make-it-a-treasure-hunt sort of thing, if other casinos will start to hide random businesses in the nooks of their properties?

      After reading a review we decided to check this place out- as most have mentioned it's down a hallway with no signs-when we first got there nobody was in the place and the staff was in the back. but then fernando came out to help us. he was truly passionate about his workplace and the product. we ended up trying 4 different slices and they were all good-The crust was what made it so good, It's nice you can go into a top notch hotel(the Cosmopolitan is beautiful) and get a meal with a beer for under $20.  I hope they don't get too popular.............

      After reading all the fab reviews on this place I made it a mission to go on a super secret pizza hunt. NY style pizza? with how much I have been missing my home lately I needed to get my crack pizza fix. After walking all around, hunting, and putting my super pizza senses to work my friend and I found this place. 3rd floor. hidden back with a walk along vintage album covers. I am giving it a star for all the top secret pizza business going on, but to be honest I was let down with the pizza. The employees were eh and after waiting and looking at each other for a few minutes they asked if we needed any help. I ordered the margarita pizza while my friend just had the cheese. It was thin like nyc, but very hard. I had to work to fold my pizza. (yes, i am a folder. stop judging me las vegas.) i'm use to my pizza being so hot that it burns the roof of my mouth leaving me with a reminder for days of that glorious pizza i consumed days before. This one was warm but not hot. It lacked a certain flavor, but I couldn't put my finger on what. My friend said his basic cheese slice tasted no different then sbarro's, I was mad at myself for paying 4 bucks for this slice, but what can ya do? the hunt was fun and maybe this would be good pizza after an evening of drinking inside the cosmo, but coming from a new yorker this is not new york style pizza. sorry super secret pizzeria, but you didn't win over my heart.

      As a few Yelpers have noted in previous posts, the actual name of the pizzeria is Nico's, but I will always remember it as "Secret Pizza".When you walk by, it's easy to miss. But take the time and enjoy the many record album covers that adorn the walls. I busted a gut, for sure. That hallway will lead you to a pinball machine and voilà!, you've found your pot of gold.   Staying at the Cosmo, my husband and I decided to take full use of our amazing room and bask in the glory of pizza on our balcony overlooking the Bellagio water show. In about twenty minutes, our pizza was ready and we were on that elevator so fast. The pizza was very good and a nice break from formal dining on the Strip. Highly recommended for those general hankerings for pizza in Vegas.

      what?! this place has a name?! i thought it was just PIZZA... like on the menu. haha...  all that aside.. this place is AAWWWEEESOOOMMMMME!! again if you read my previous posts, i am not a huge fan of pizza. but i ate here three times while in vegas. hehehheheh....  the prices are the bombdotcom --- where else on the vegas strip are you gonna have an amazing slice for such a great price!?!?! we had a whole pie with tomatoes and ricotta cheese. and it was sooooooo good. the sauce was light and flavourful. the toppings very fresh. crust was perfect!!  i love that this place was on the main restaurant floor of the cosmopolitan.. floor three. unassuming... long hallway covered in old rat pack album covers and the like.. vegas pinball machine, simple decor. loved the paper plates and red dixie cups too. can't wait to go back!

      Apparently it's easier to find than I thought it'd be, my friends weren't even looking for it and found it. I was looking for it and probably passed the hall 3 times without going down it. I finally found it after a late night hanging out at Book &amp; Stage Lounge, I don't know if it was because it was 3:00 in the morning, I had 3 bourbons in me, or I hadn't eaten since 7pm the night before. But the pizza was heaven, I went for good old plain cheese, it's the easiest way to tell if its really good pizza, cuz it can stand on its own. Gooey, cheesy, nice sheen of grease over the top, crust was good for being in Las Vegas. prices were excellent. The staff was fun and friendly.  The "pizza man" scolded my hubby for picking up the pepper shaker before trying the pizza, I swear his accent was fake but he was entertaining, made the wait in line easier. I can't wait to go back. If thye keep up the good work I may not get as home sick for the east coast.

      There is not much to say about this place that has not yet been said, so I will just note that I went here twice in one day for $3 cheese pizza and it was excellent. I would go three times in one day if I could. My friends from out of town (Texas and England) seemed to want to eat non-pizza food, though. I don't know what's wrong with them.  The only downside is the serious lack of seating (six seats) but the Cosmopolitan has seating EVERYWHERE. We had drinks in the Chandelier beforehand, which I highly recommend.

      Get ready to wait in line for a few minutes on a Sat night. Very new York style.  Loved the Pizza.  specialy the all cheese pizza, it was delicious.   If you love thin crust, you will appreciate this pizza.  My husband and I are a fan of this place and we are looking forward to having it again everytime we are in Vegas.  reasonable price. ps. i cant believe the location!!! No marketing no signs.  Its a whole in a wall place in a really nice hotel! ....its Cosmo's best kept secret.
