      A great, inexpensive, off the Strip dining choice for Spanish tapas. I went there with my mom and aunt and several friends and really enjoyed myself.

      AN extra star because they are open until 2 a.m. but minus a half a star because they don't tell you when you call that you need reservations even at 11:30 at night.  Thankfully you can sit at the bar and apparently the place has regulars so pull your stool up to one of them, and if sober, they'll tell you what's good or not.  This joint is jumping and its easy to understand why; the service is fast and friendly, the food is very tasty, a bit creative and very inexpensive.  My and my hungry mouth sister went and with cocktails had a bill of only $30.  I thought I was back in South America and the menu's latin style flavor only reinforces that.  We passed on the famous (soaks 3 days for flavor!) sangria but enjoyed a number of delights.  Their signature Firefly fries are a bit greasy but quite tasty.

      This was my favorite meal in Vegas.  The tapas were tasty, and though Spanish cuisine is usually difficult for a vegan I found plenty to eat.  The blood orange mojitos were great.  The servers were very cool, projecting a low key but attentive persona.  I would certainly eat here again.  The tomato soup is fabulous.  The patio is painted in a scuffed red and is delightful if you can stand the smokers.

      Came here for a friend's bday celebration this weekend. Pretty good tapas place a street parallel of the strip. Everything was pretty reasonably priced and the food was pretty yummy.  After a couple Heine's, sangrias and Millers we got a bit rowdy but it was all in fun and other people seemed to be tolerable of the racket we caused.  Minus a star for not being able to sing Happy Birthday to their diners. We had to do that ourselves and had a great time. =)

      My friend lives for this place - taking all visitors to Vegas to one his favorite spots to drink, eat and be merry.  We started off with a pitcher of the White Sangria ($18.00).  It was nice to even have that option.  I was a bit disappointed with the lack of fruit. If you read any of previous entries regarding sangria, I live for all that fruit shit marinating in the wine!  So, bring it on!   I remember getting a complimentary  Firefly*fries (parmesan, herbs, aioli) to start of our meal - anything complimentary is ALWAYS appreciated!  Some of the tapas we ordered included Stuffed dates (bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese) $4,  Patatas bravas (roasted red potatoes in spicy aioli) $4.50, and some kind of meat tapa.  Sadly, I can't remember much else about what we had that evening.   In all fairness, I didn't have much of an appetite.  I was, uh *ahem*, recovering still and couldn't enjoy the various goodies that arrived at our table.  But I would definitely give it another go because I usually love tapas and I'm confident that if I was in my healthy state, this place would rate higher.  Update! 02/26/07 - I finally got around to trying this place out again, and this time I was healthy and hungry!  It's Friday night and packed!  With an hour and half wait, we wing it outside under the heating lamps.  They started us off with bread, some type of buttery spread, and olives.  We ordered the ceviche of shrimp, which was tiger shrimp, avocado, and two corn tortilla chips ($8.50).  The ceviche was good, not sure how much shrimp was actually in the dish though and only two chips?  The roasted eggplant cannelloni, made with goat cheese and tomato sauce ($5.00) was a surprise hit.  It came in a set of three and the BF definitely plans on ordering this one again.  Tasty, especially if you're a goat cheese lover.  We order the lamb chops medium, and they came a bit overcooked.  With two chops, a red wine reduction, and sauteed lentils and veggies ($8.50), you got a bit more bang for your buck.  The baked filets of grouper that are marinated with herbs, lemon and garlic ($6.50) came with three pieces and lacked flavor.  I ended up using the sauce from my ceviche to give it a kick.  The pulpo asado, which is marinated and grilled octopus with a few red potatoes and chopped tomatoes ($7.50) was okay too.  We finished off with the BF's favorite - Banana-Nutella Sandwiches ($5.00).  This came with four triangles and you're supposed to dip it into the Nutella sauce.  The sauce was cold when we got it, but the BF claims it's usually served warm.  With a party of four, we shared a pitcher of their passion fruit Mojitos ($7.00/glass; $28.00/pitcher) that was pretty yummy.  (I love mojitos!)  Overall, the food was okay.  We couldn't enjoy their meat dishes as much b/c our company was doing the "No Meat Friday" thing.  I'm upping my star rating from a three to a four because the atmosphere is good, and with tapas, everyone seems to have a good time.  I would definitely recommend making reservations though for busy evenings!  Happy Hour is Mondays through Fridays from 3 pm to 6 pm.  1/2 Firefly Drinks (sangria, mojitos, specialty martinis, and infused vodka) and well drinks.  Appetizer plate is included   Appetizer plate included, which is 1 stuffed date, 1 albondiga, and 1 tortilla espanola.

      A great location that's somewhat off the Strip, but very close to all the major hotels - easily accessible if you have a car.  The bar was a little tight, but it's a very popular location.  Great music, even though when I was eating, there wasn't a live band.  It's not the most authentic Spanish food around, but it's a great departure from the standard steakhouses and buffets in Vegas.  BTW, I realized that if you say "I'm going to a tapas bar" that it sounds like something not so innocent.  Good for a laugh or two (but gets old very quick).  It's also a handy way to find out how dirty your friends are.  PROS: - Reasonably priced (about $25/pp with some drinks) - Wide variety of choices on the menu - White wine sangria is very light and easy to drink - I really liked the empanadas, duck rolls, and  - In a plaza with several restaurants, including Ruth's Chris - so if there's a long wait, there is always an alternative  CONS: - The paella was the worst thing I've ever eaten in a tapas bar - The bruschetta was a close second

      The food here was surprisingly good and the service was perfect.  I ordered several tapas...the best was the calamari and the worst was the octopus (it was like a "fear factor" challenge).  Even though the food was exceptional, I can't imagine returning since it just wasn't my scene.  Any time I looked around the room, I was horrified by the other people there.  Mostly 30-something's who get their fashion ideas from TRL (the table near me had a young father with a mohawk and his little baby had a mohawk too).   Now that I think about it, there was a lot of bad hair.

      If you're in the mood for tapas. Check out Firefly on Paradise next time you're in Las Vegas. Located off the strip and away from all the riff raff, Firefly offers yummy ceviche of red snapper, stuffed dates, roasted eggplant canneloni, tuna carpaccio, baked shrimp with roasted garlic cream, chorizo clams, empanadillas, skewer of beef, and so much more.   I had a great experience here, much better than any of the overpriced fine dining restaurants in Vegas.  With excellent service and reasonable prices. Tourists, venture off of Las Vegas Blvd and onto Paradise Road!!

      whenever i have guests coming to vegas wanting to eat well, drink well, and be merry...i take them to firefly.  they serve spanish tapas, they have pitchers of delicious sangria, they have live music on certain evenings, it's off the strip, and they are open late.  start off with a pitcher of sangria.  i recommend the white if you have a bunch of newbies that don't like wine too much.  i usually have the ceviche w red snapper, the boquerones which are spanish white anchovies on toasts w/roasted red pepper, my absolute favorite almond and blue-cheese stuffed sweet dates that are wrapped in salty fatty bacon. garlicky and cheezy firefly fries, my other favorite merguez ([spicy lamb sausage), tender sweet lamb chops, camarones a la diabla, and to finish it off with the extrodinary banana-nutella sandwiches. i wouldnt recommend this place as nice great date place because it does get loud when it's very busy and with live music playing in the background.  they also have outdoor seating.  this place can get really busy.  i would call in advance to see if reservations are needed.  this is a really fun place to go to.

      So I went to this place with pals J. and M. It was my last night hanging out in Vegas, and we were talking about coming here because of two things we have a love of: bacon, and mojitos. Well, I was satisfied.  This little tapas bar was definitely full of an early evening swingles crowd in sequined halters and those non-wrinkle-able slacks, but there were also some large groups and families sitting around. We got a table outside on the heated patio and the waiter brought a basket of yummy crostinis, black olives, and a sweet/garlicy butter.   I had a raspberry mojito, and also tried the blood orange one. Both were delicious and I'm sure the other selections from the bar are just as good. Absolutely, you must try the figs wrapped in bacon in a red wine reduction, and the tuna tartar. Although not enough taro chips for the tuna tartar.  Other things worth trying are a variety of skewers, ceviche, and artichoke toasts.   Our service was incredibly slow, although supposedly that is not the case at Firefly usually.

      i live in vegas and this restaurant is one of my favorite places. for tourists, if you wanna jus chill and hang away from the strip, this is the perfect place. their sangrias (both red &amp; white kinds) are Bomb!  it's a tapas joint, so many varieties of different kinds of foods (not just spanish food either) but they have mini burgers, beef tenderloin skewers, ribs, veggie dishes, and of course desserts (my favorite is this banana one that you can dip into hazelnut chocolate)  anyways, long story short, great drinks and food at an affordable price, so def check it out!

      A nice inexpensive, Spanish tapas restaurant located off the strip. I went there with my friend Tabitha her boyfriend, and a three other mutual friends. They make a pretty good mojito. All of my friends and I really enjoyed ourselves. And yes there open late.

      Was taken here for a business outing during my trip to Vegas for a conference.  How did I like it?  Luved it....sure did.....not only because it was off the strip and outside of a casino with fresh air and without the sounds of slot machine bells but because the food and sangria were d-lish-us.  Damn straight.    If you go, try to take friends.  Tapas are meant to be shared so the more people, the more plates.  Order the empanadas, the duck rolls, the cerviche, and most everything on the menu.  I am not a fan of lamb so I stayed away from those dishes.  Atmosphere was pretty good and music generated a great vibe in the place.  Definitely recommend it.    **They just opened a sister joint next door called Dragonfly.  It's a sushi place.

      So, Firefly is becoming a weekend tradition with my crew.  And even more exciting....John (the restaurants owner/chef) has opened a sequel next door called Dragonfly...we'll talk about that later.  Tapas is a treat, literally.  And the best way to pigout with friends for less money that you would expect. It's like ordering a table full of appetizers.   Hmmm....like TGI Friday's, but good.  Firefly friend pleaser's.......Jug O' Red Sangria                                                Baked Brie and/or Cheese &amp; Meat Plate                                                Empanadas  Yummy and way fun to share.  An awesome bar.  Thankfully a bar that knows how to make a kick ass martini.  Cuz when the Sangria is gone you might as well kick it up a notch. BAM!!!  And it sports a pleasing trendy atmosphere at Happy Hour.  Believe me....wall to wall SHINY HAPPY PEOPLE.   Men who use product, and the women who love them.  Wink, wink.

      Rachael Ray led me astray...  I tried this place after seeing RR's review on her show.  While the atmosphere and ambiance are nice, you'll leave finding the food mediocre at best.

      So I guess this is Tapas Day. So Firefly - I've driven by so many times - Saw it on Rachel Ray's $40 a day....Hmmm finally went there and was quite impressed. BTW THERE IS NO THAI BEEF SALAD IN SPAIN. Whatever and your tapas fusion. Overall - great atmosphere. A little Loud....Drinks are delish. Hmmm Reading all reviews...I'm just gonna copy and paste everyone's to make my own :) Mwahahaha Behold Plagerism!!! A great, inexpensive, off the Strip dining choice for Spanish tapas. AN extra star because they are open until 2 a.m. but minus a half a star because they don't tell you when you call that you need reservations even at 11:30 at night.  Firefly is a welcome alternative to the overpriced strip restaurants and clubs.  This is where all of the local crowd hangs out.  It's up the street from the Hard Rock, quick cab-ride from the strip.  Great food, hip but relaxed atmosphere.  Open late with DJ's and more of a bar/loungey crowd the later it gets.   BTW, I realized that if you say "I'm going to a tapas bar" that it sounds like something not so innocent.  Good for a laugh or two (but gets old very quick).  It's also a handy way to find out how dirty your friends are. So, Firefly is becoming a weekend tradition with my crew.  And even more exciting....John (the restaurants owner/chef) has opened a sequel next door called Dragonfly...we'll talk about that later.  Tapas is a treat, literally.  And the best way to pigout with friends for less money that you would expect. It's like ordering a table full of appetizers.   Hmmm....like TGI Friday's, but good.  Firefly friend pleaser's.......Jug O' Red Sangria                                               Baked Brie and/or Cheese &amp; Meat Plate                                               Empanadas  Yummy and way fun to share.

Mwahahaha and that is my review completely not plagerized and true... No Really I knocked it for the crowdedness, and noise levels, oh and for we had really crappy seats when we went....table small. Myke SMASH....

      Basically all I can say, because I'm apparently the last person on earth to go here, is:  Hey everyone!  I agree!  Holy poop is this stuff excellent!  I suggested this last night on a whim.  I've been before, but always with people who didn't want to wait.  We did have to wait about 25 - 30 minutes, but my dining partner assured me it was worth it.  We were able to get a seat at the bar and ordered a pitcher of sangria to share.    They have two sangria varieties - red wine and white wine.  We had the white wine and it was delicious - light and refreshing.  After we were seated we were seen promptly by our waiter and it didn't take long for us to choose our selections, all of which were marvelous.  We had the filet mignon sliders, baked brie, camarones a la diabla, and chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms.  Everything was prepared perfectly and was absolutely delicious.  The sauce on the shrimp was divine, and the brie was paired with some deliciously roasted tomatoes.  The only downside was that our waiter seemed to forget about us after our food had arrived and we sat without the bill for a while.  But, while we sat we talked about how good the food was.  Recommended for any occasion.  So flippin' good.

      Wanting to stay away from the hotel dining  scene we headed over to "Firefly"!  Holy crap....This place was PACKED on Friday night.  Luckily we had a reservation for 6 and only waited for a about 10mins for a table.  Without reservations we would have been looking at at least an hour wait.  Overall we had a great experience.   The sangria was good and the tapas were even better.  Great little people watching spot to boot.  And last but not least, since I treated my peeps it wasn't  too hard on my AMEX card.  We will definitely be back...

      A great tapas restaurant! Had trouble deciding what to order because there're so many things on the menu I want to try. Of course I ordered the mushroom tart because I LOVE mushroom (see my russian family bistro review). The fried calamari is a bit oily though. Everything else was good, but not so spectacular that I remember the individual dish to put on this review.  We also ordered a pitcher of sangria, but later on I found out that I actually do not like sangria. So my boy had to finish the whole pitcher by himself. Not that he's complaining.  I'd definitely come back!

      If you are like me, every time you go to a restaurant and take a look at the menu you wish you can be gluttonous and order everything on the menu because you either can't narrow it down to just one dish or you just want a little taste of everything. Look no further....Firefly is just the remedy if ever you are in that situation. A Tapas restaurant and favorite local hangout, Firefly's atmosphere is just as cool as it's food!! My favorites are the Surf and Turf Skewers, Tuna Tartar, Baked Brie, Crab-cake Sliders and of course the Sangria!! If you are looking for great, inexpensive food, awesome atmosphere that is open late and even has happy hour....Firefly is definitely for you!!

      4/19/07  Hands down the best Tapas and Sangria place I've ever been to.  Including NYC and Europe.  Great atmosphere, location, music, staff.  Nothing lacking here, except maybe more parking spots.  A great find in the land of CORPORATE Dining.  And those mentioning all the fake boobies and K-Fed lookalikes...  HELLO!  This IS Vegas, they're everywhere!!!  And TAPAS is about little dishes to talk over and socialize over.  It doesn't have to stick to traditional Spanish ingredients.

      The light sangria was good- although a bit tooo "iced up" and the chunks of fruit needs to be a little bigger. The stuffed dates would have been good if the bacon wasn't to dry or crisp- i think prosciutto would've worked better...but the sliders were good. the ambiance kind of sucked- we ate outside and it was literally in the middle of the parking lot- it would have been nice if they could've covered it with greenery or face the outside dining on the sidewalk to see passer-by's even then it was kind of whacked...i guess coming from the hotels and all of sudden being out in the middle of the parking lot- i have to take off points for the ambiance...our waiter kind of sucked too- you would think they would at least talk about the menu a bit and be excited about being there! i guess if you're gonna check this place out- I suggest you eat inside- the place is forgettable not one i'd go back to when I'm Vegas...I've had better tapas and sangrias...
