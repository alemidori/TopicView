      Having been to the OG location in Manhattan's Meatpacking District, my expectations were going to be high!    I've been a fan of Scott ever since I've tried out some of his recipes from Bold Italio.  Whom I refer to as the anti Mario Batali.  Conant's sense of `new Italian' cooking is also different from Mario, who, with his love of ramps (a type of leek).  Scott sees himself as adapting the Italian concentration on local ingredients with those ingredients which are local to the farms.   I started out with the Mussels and Asparagus Soup was hearty which a nice assortments of spring veggies. The polenta with a fricassee of truffled mushrooms was as usual excellent and the Grilled Bread and Goat Cheese Salad were also great starters.  The boneless Osso Busco with orzo pasta was phenomenal.  It was braised in a boldly flavored sauce.    The spaghetti with tomato and basil seems simple but delicious, a must-try!  This restaurant is in a great spot with nice window views of the Bellagio Fountain ,  Hip and Happening for a Upscale Trattoria and based on how packed it  has hit the ground running on the Strip.

      Scarpetta is at the newly opened Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas and we dropped by on a whim and are glad we did.  This turned out to be a sensational dining experience.  Every single morsel of food that passed our lips was a taste sensation.  We started out with the seared sea scallops, the chestnut soup and the beet salad.  Each was out of this world delicious!  Our entrees consisted of the black cod which was buttery and perfect, the Sicilian spiced duck breast which was tender and tasty and the duck and foie gras ravioli which was creamy and sensational.  We ended our dinner with two desserts and I would highly recommend the Coconut Panna Cotta Guava Soup with Carmelized Pineapple.  Double-yum!  Service was outstanding and although we did not have have a table with a view overlooking the Las Vegas Strip, we enjoyed our comfortable booth with room enough on the table for all the dishes we ordered. I would DEFINITELY want to return to this restaurant again and would highly recommend it to everyone.

      So much potential here, the experience was really 3 star but I'm optimistic.  Great layout with large S-curved bank seating and a nice north facing view of the Bellagio fountain. Service is great but the kitchen timing needs work. Food came out a bit slow and a bit cold which is normally a big time no-no but they are new and working out the kinks.  Food is delicious, apps of short ribs and polenta truffles with mushrooms make for a great start. Polenta was creamy and truffle accents were spot on.   Pastas are house-made and cooked just al-dente. Easy to do but somehow few places get it right. The spaghetti with creamy tomato and basil, just perfect, a great representation of Italian food in its simplistic goodness. Black cod done well, cooked nicely.   Duck and foie gras ravioli was a bit salty and cold and the agnolotti seemed too one dimensional. Both were slightly warm and would have been better paired with a side. Plates seemed a bit bare.  Desserts-  very creative. Napoleon-  deconstructed creme brulee with blood oranges, sweet and creamy, amazing combination.   Nutella warm molten chocolate bites with hazelnuts were also deliciously comforting.   Overall, given the lack of decent Italian eateries with value on the Strip, it's worth a visit. Once they get the timing down, the kitchen and the service make this a sure-bet for a quality meal.

      In Las Vegas for a long weekend just a few days after the grand opening, i ended up at Scarpetta for a late dinner seating. The concierge at the Cosmopolitan hotel was about as nice and as accommodating as you could hope to have and she hooked me and my smoking hot date up. The place looks amazing and i dont now who they thought we were but we got the million dollar table. It must have been that new Calvin Klein dress i was wearing that made them think i was deserving of a table that overlooked the Bellagio fountains. I even asked my hot date if he tipped for that table, he swore he didn't. Whatever I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth i just enjoyed the amazing beautiful view and got ready to eat.   The service... Impeccable. Charming on the ball waiter with not too much sass but just enough chit chat. The food was prompt and delicious. I had the creamy truffle polenta and  super yummy black macaroni with lobster and Mr handsome across the table from me had the goat which was really good too. I know because even though i dont eat goat cuz i think its gross, he made me taste it and it was.. well, really good. And that's from a goat hater! The wine list is deep but not over complicated, even a wine Jr leauger like myself could find my way around it.  It was a real romantic fairytale night out, exactly what you think fine dinning should be. It was fancy with out being stuck up, tasty with out being weird. Scarpetta LV is a real winner.

      Amazing experience!! Started with a couple cocktails at the very hip/swanky bar. Was led to our table by a stunning hostess. We overlooked the Bellagio fountains, by far one of the best veiws in Vegas.   We took our seats and were greeted by a very friendly server who offered great suggestions and answered all of our food questions.    We looked thru the wine list and decided to ask for a somm to guide us. A smartly dressed younger gentleman came to our table and convinced us to try something new and interesting. It was a little more then I usually spend but decided to trust him. I have to say he really nailed it! Amazing wine, we wound up buying another bottle half way thru our meal!  Speaking of the meal....spectacular!! Perfectly cooked pasta, my duck was incredible. The service through out was impressive to say the least. The best I've had in Vegas in quite a long time. We will be back again for sure!

      What a disappointment. Food was overpriced for the portion size, not cooked properly (pasta undercooked and lobster over seasoned), and just lacked any creativity. Service was non existent. It took 15 minutes to get a soda and 20 to get bread.   Try something else in cosmopolitan before this place.

      One of the most over priced Italian restaurants I've experienced. The portions were miniscule while the prices were stratospheric. The quality was so-so. My raviolis were so dry they were hard to swallow. The gingerbread desert was unremarkable for $11. Pasta dishes were in the $20-30. Better make sure there is a McDonald's in the area to hit after this dinner!!!!

      Easily made reservations via OpenTable earlier in the day for a prime time on Friday night.  When my date and I arrived, we were quickly seated and they checked our coats for us. They have a very respectable wine selection and presentation of their stock. The acoustics were very good; even sitting at an table near the middle, we were able to converse with regular voices. Service was quick and very polite. I ordered the roasted duck and was very pleased with the dish. My date ordered the cod filet and wasn't so thrilled, but loved the squash soup appetizer.  For dessert we shared the chocolate cake with almond gelato and it was amazing.  I will definitely return to this hotel and restaurant in the future.

      Thomas Keller needs to eat here.  Why?  When Keller was contemplating opening a restaurant in Vegas, he refused to consider putting up a branch of The French Laundry there because, in his opinion, Vegas was too informal and boisterous for an experience which intended to be intensely focused and all-encompassing.  Scarpetta, however, proves that this idea is outdated.  This is a restaurant, located right in the center of the action on the Las Vegas strip which, despite the non-ending commotion, offers an experience in which the diner is able to enjoy the entirety of a meal without nary a distraction.  Las Vegas, instead of detracting from the experience of a fine meal, is now enhancing it.

      Had a delicious tasting menu Sunday night - pre Valentine's.  Best seat in the house next to the window overlooking Bellagio fountains - terrific, attentive service.    Delicious food - the executive chef, Dan Rossi worked with Alex for 14 years...therefore, good technique, now cooking Italian very nicely.  Vita Shanley's desserts are delicious.  naturally....  Masterful front of house....  plus Antonello's back in town.    Great team of some of my most favorite professionals in a spectacularly lovely location making great food....    Any questions?

      I love Scarpetta :)  The spaghetti there is delicious. I ran into Scott Conant at the South Beach Food &amp; Wine Festival and he insisted I try out his restaurant. I'm glad I did. When I lived in Miami I frequented the Scarpetta in the Fontainebleau. The bars in the Miami Scarpetta v the Vegas Scarpetta are very similar. I like the layout of the Vegas Scarpetta better but the views of the two restaurants are the same. Miami overlooks the Fontainebleau pool area and water and Vegas overlooks the Bellagio fountains. The most recent visit to the Vegas Scarpetta was my favorite. One of the specials that night was a black truffle pasta. AMAZING. It was so delicious and filling, total comfort food. Granted it was a $60 (small, probably nutrionally not good for my figure) bowl of pasta but worth every penny (and bite).  Of course service was spot on and the house Riesling was great.

      I had heard about Scarpetta multiple times on Travel Channel (Anthony Bourdain) and Food Network (Best Thing I ever Ate).  Scott Conant is also a celebrity chef that is on some Food Network shows.  I happened to be at a conference at the Cosmopolitan (my new favorite hotel in Vegas, BTW), and I figured I might as well stop by and try out the food at Scarpetta.  The inside of the restaurant has a good view of the faux lake at the Bellagio.  Big windows and a nice decor are the first thing you notice.  The food is what we were really there for, so I was excited about that.  For appetizer, we ordered duck and foie gras ravioli's with a wine reduction sauce.  This was just amazing....heavy and rich, but it is foie gras, so you should expect that.  Since it was a regular menu item and not an appetizer, they split it in half for my co-worker and I.  Upon receiving the raviolis, our server (who was very good....attentive and knowledgable) brought over a basket of 3 breads.  One was ciabatta, one was a focaccia (or something similar) with pork (prosciutto, maybe?) and cheese rolled into it.  I can't remember the third bread, but it was also good.  Next up was the main meal.  I ordered the spaghetti (with tomato and basil), and my co-worker ordered the branzino.  The spaghetti is what I had seen featured multiple times on TV, and I am always a skeptic.  I didn't think it could possibly be the best spaghetti I had ever had, but I was wrong.  This spaghetti was the absolute best I have ever had.  There was so much flavor concentrated on FRESH pasta.  Every bite was heaven, and for $24, I would order it again for sure.  Vegas (and NY) are both expensive for nice restaurants, so the price tag is high compared to your local favorite Italian place, but the pasta just isn't the same.  My co-workers branzino was also excellent.  Served with some greens and onion, it was cooked perfectly (crispy skin), and the flavor was very fresh.    I can't say enough about this restaurant.  I highly recommend anyone going to the Cosmopolitan check this place out.  Definitely one of my better dining experiences for Italian food.

      Wow. This place is pretty expensive, but it is worth every penny.  The service was spot on. Everything you would expect where you'll spend about $100+ per person on dinner.  Portions are small (well actually portions are normal size, they just seem small compared to most other places that try to impress you with mediocre food by giving you a lot).   For starters we had scallops - very good, cooked perfectly.  Seared perfectly for a nice crunch, and tender on the inside. And we had the creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms. Wow, the polenta was full of flavor, and the truffled mushrooms were amazing. One of the best things I have ever ate.  We also had a pasta course (cannot remember what it was called), but it was almost like a ravioli and was stuffed with a meat puree of chicken and veal. The texture was super creamy, like a pate. This pasta was amazing. We also had the duck and foie gras ravioli. Even more amazing than the previous pasta. Tender pasta, the sauce was perfect, and the duck and foie gras was in a perfect balance.  For our main course we had 2 orders of veal loins wrapped in pancetta and served with sweetbreads and roasted vegetables. Let's just say there was nothing left on my plate.  Next we had dessert.  Tiney doughnuts (zepolle) filled with nutella and served with cream anglaise. I was so full, but managed to eat every one. We also had the cheesecake. Which was very very good.  This place will not disappoint. But you will spend some money. Our bill was 300 after tip, an we did not have any alcohol. Add a bottle of wine and it would have been about a 400 meal.  But no regrets. I'd go back as often as I could afford to.

      My friends and I were seated with a view of the Bellagio fountains and it was great! Service was good.   The 4 different types of bread were really good. I had to stop myself or I wouldn't have room to eat my main course.   I had the duck and foie gras ravioli. The pasta was cooked perfect and the filling was rich but a little too salty for me. The wine reduction added a good balance to the pasta.  But the star is definitely the spaghetti. It had an amazing flavor with a slight bite that goes very well with the perfectly cooked pasta.   The Amedei chocolate cake was delicious! It was a perfect balance of richness and decadence for a chocolate cake.   My biggest disappointment was the soda drinks. I asked if they had other soda options besides fountain like Gus and Dry sodas but Scarpetta doesn't. I asked for a Ginger Ale. Without notification and with my assumption that fountain drinks are unlimited refills, I had 4 tiny glasses of mostly ice and maybe 4 oz of soda. My soda bill was $16. I had the waiter removed the extra charges.  Overall, it was a great restaurant with good food, service, and view. I'll try it again but look at other drink options.

      La pasta perfetto!  Sometimes the simplest things can be magical when executed perfectly.  This is the case with Scarpetta, Scott Conant's debut into the Las Vegas restaurant scene.    The decor is understated and classy, in shades of black, white and gray.  A knowledgable and unpretentious waitstaff makes the experience all that much better, as they walk you through the menu.  A few tables along the wall rest next to big windows which overlook the neon shimmer of the strip below.  If you're coming here with a small group, definitley request one of these tables.    Adesso, il Cibo  (Now, the food)  Yellowtail Carpaccio -  Four paper-thin slices of yellowtail treated with fine olive oil and a bit of garlic.  High quality fish and a gentle hand made this appetizer balanced and elegant.  Waygu Beef Tartare - Diced  Waygu beef treated in a similar fashion to the yellowtail, but with a more pronounced garlic note at the end.  Very straightforward and satisfying.  Spaghetti Marinara - As many have said, this is the best spaghetti you will ever eat.  The housemade Al Dente spaghetti is toothsome and tender.  Somehow, the chefs here are able to pull the purest essence of tomato and basil out in this dish.  The simultaneous subtley and complexity of the flavor profile here is truly incredible.  I've spent a lot of time in Italy, and honestly cannot think of a spaghetti that holds a candle to this masterpiece.  A must order!  Black Mac n' Lobster - I believe the black color of the noodles comes from squid ink, but I could be mistaken.  Very nice flavors of lobster and the sea.  The texture was quite similar to the spaghetti, which I found to be redundant, but that was an error in my ordering, and nothing to do with the execution of the dish.    Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli w/ Marsala Reduction - The food that kings eat!  The ravioli was immaculate, formed with care and the love you'd expect from a homemade Italian meal.  I found the combination of duck, foie gras, and the marsala reduction to be a bit too heavy.  I could see people raving about this dish, but for me it was just too much of a good thing.  Branzino - Gentle white fish with a lightly crisped skin and honest flavors.  One of the best cooked fish plates I can remember having.  Dry Aged Filet - The pink/gray color of this steak is visually contradictory to what you might find at a fine steak house, but that is due to the dry aging process.  It was tender, flavorful, and neat.   Yes the bread is incredible as well, but let's not fill up on bread.  Scarpetta is a great date spot if you're looking to splurge.  Do not leave without ordering the spaghetti, its the type of dish you'll tell your grandkids about.

      How do I describe the love? Love, Love, LOVE! I have previously dined at Scarpetta in New York, and was ecstatic to check ou the new space at The Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas.   Our server, was hands down one of the best in the business. Full of passion and enthusiasm for his food, we were truly excited for our dishes. Being that we had a party of 5, he removed our menu's from our hands and told us that the chef would be preparing something fantastic for us. We ended up with small plates of 4 courses: starting with appetizers, pasta (duck fois gras ravioli, linguini with black truffle, their famed spagetti); a branzino and meat affair for the 3rd course (Sicilian spiced duck breast, and seared scallops...plus many more items (I believe it was 5 plates for each course) for party to share, which was fantastic!   Hands down, best Italian meal that I've had in years. I will be back very soon. Ciao!

      Is it bad if you go to a restaurant in Vegas that you've been to elsewhere? I don't care. My sister and I went here for an incredible dinner. The service was fantastic. We were seated next to the window so we got to watch the fountains the entire night (contrary to what you might expect I did not get bored watching them over and over again). We started with the polenta w/mushrooms because I love it, the yellowtail, which was delicious and super fresh, and the scallops which were awesome. My sister had the infamous spaghetti which she loved (and I did too). My dish was out of control - it is called the black macaroni and if I could eat it all the time I would. It is squid ink pasta (not macaroni) with lobster and BASIL BREAD CRUMBS. I cannot describe how perfect this dish is - or how obsessed I now am with basil bread crumbs. Truly amazing. We got the zeppole for dessert. *Love* - truly excellent and wonderful - I wasn't expecting this level of awesome. I need to go to the one in nyc now so I can have the trifecta.

      First off, I would have to say Scarpetta's service is impeccable.  If we could just rate our waiter alone, we would give him a 5 star rating!  He was knowledgeable, friendly, and humble.  I have seen far too many waiters in Vegas who don't care, or are extremely snooty because my husband and I look young even though we're not.    As for the food, we order the scallops as the appetizer, and the duck and foie gras ravioli and the spaghetti as our entree.  For the scallops-I feel that it was good-but I have had better.  The duck and foie gras ravioli is their stand out dish!!  The wine reduction and marsala sauce on top of the ravioli made it so delicious.  The actual ravioli themselves are shaped like triangles.  I can tell there that is this delicacy to the outside when they were making it.  The duck and foie gras inside is very unique, and not like anything my husband and I have tasted before.  This dish deserves a 5 star.  Finally, for the spaghetti.  I was extremely excited to try this dish because I read all these reviews on yelp explaining that it was amazing.  However, we were a little disappointed maybe because we were expecting so much.  Don't get me wrong-the pasta is still good.  However, it's not the amazing that it was made out to be.  Overall, if I could give Scarpetta a 4 1/2 stars, I would.  My husband and I will definitely be back if when we go back to Vegas.

      Scarpetta serves the best bread basket I have ever seen. And I don't say that lightly.  I would've been happy with either the fluffy dinner rolls, the buttery, toasted focaccia, or the simple, crusty Italian bread on their own. And any one of the citrus-infused olive oil, the eggplant caponata or the marscopone butter accompaniments would have been not only generous, but irresistibly delicious.  Surprisingly, Scarpetta lays every one of these items in front of you in a sumptuous, complimentary carby feast, along with the absolute kicker: STROMBOLI. That's meaty, cheesey bread, people; it's a meal in itself, and a damn good one.   I knew I shouldn't, but I couldn't help but stuff my face with the free delights. And although I was already full when they arrived, I forced myself to choke down the simple, perfect spaghetti, as well as a beautifully rare aged sirloin in a Barolo reduction.  I might not have any friends and/or social skills, and later that evening, I may or may not have lost my pants* downstairs playing craps...but eating this flawless meal means I'm a winner anyway. __________  *I think The Bellagio is now in possession of my shirt. Now I've got nothing.

      Exceptional service and a fab decor. The food.....yummy but I'm not rushing back. With all the amazing restaurants here there are others I'd rather go back to. The spaghetti with marinara sauce is what the chef is known for....now that I'd have a second helping of. All the rest was really good but not memorable since I can't even recall exactly what it was.

      This review is based on a dinner visit.  Atmosphere - 4.5:  From the entrance it's a little difficult to get a sense of the restaurant because you can only see the long bar which you must walk through to get to the main seating area of the restaurant.  I initially thought it was an extension of the DOCG Enoteca, which is next door.  Once you reach the main seating area you will find a nicely decorated dining room that features views of the Bellagio fountains in one direction, and their extensive wine cellar in the opposite direction.  Menu - 4.5:  Great menu with very creative options.  The portions are small and the staff is really good about helping ensure you get the right amount of food.  Of course, as with many fine dining experiences you will pay for it if you are a big eater.  Service - 3:  The service was mixed.  The sommelier was fantastic; he really knew the vast wine collection and helped us find something that paired well with our group's diverse menu choices.  Our waiter, while very friendly, was just way too slow.  It took too long for everything from taking our order to getting our food.   Food delivery timing was off as one member of our group ended up watching everyone else eat while he waited.  I will say that it didn't appear that the other people in the restaurant were having the same experience.  I really think that our experience was out of the norm for some reason.  While I can't in good conscience rate the service experience any higher than 3, I would note that in my experience an establishment with a reputation for good service will usually do things to make amends when they don't deliver.  The restaurant recognized that things had not gone well for our table and took a few items off of our bill to compensate.  Food - 5:  The food was fantastic.  Especially liked the creamy truffle polenta.     Wine List - 5:  The 3,000+ bottle cellar offered plenty of choices.  The sommelier was very knowledgeable, friendly, and didn't make me feel like an idiot.    Overall - 4

      I have to say I indulged in almost every meal in my 4 day stay in Vegas, but this was by far the best. The most decadent, delicious, and just memorable.   At the tables in Cosmo friday afternoon we were pondering where to have a late dinner before hitting the clubs. The player to my left said Scarpetta had an amazing, but simple spaghetti dish that was to die for. Keeping our fingers crossed, we wandered upstairs around 6:30 and were able to secure a 9:30 reservation and requested a tiny 2 person table in the corner with a great window view. Even though we were running about 15 minutes late, they were gracious enough to hold the table for us.   Upon arrival, we didn't even have to give our name and check in, the host immediately remembered us from 3 hours earlier and sat us promptly at the requested table. The view of the Bellagio and the water show was fantastic! The only issue I had was that we were not given a menu or even a wine list for at least 10-15 minutes after we were seated. Normally this wouldn't be a problem I presume, but it was 9:30 and we were pretty much starving at this point.   After we were presented with menus though, the bread basket pretty much had our full attention for a good while. The selection of bread and spreads was DELICIOUS. We literally ate almost all of it...the focaccia was incredible. I ordered a gin and tonic, and my friend a glass of moscato. They were both delicious with our meals.   We shared the beef carpaccio appetizer, and it was absolutely delicious--just the perfect amount for 2 people to share since we weren't looking to eat a heavy meal, but wanted to try a starter. We shared 2 pasta dishes--the spaghetti everyone raves about and the duck and foie gras ravioli. Personally I absolutely savored the ravioli--i love foie gras and duck, so it was perfect. The Spaghetti my friend liked more--it was simple, but good.   Definitely coming back here on my next trip to Vegas in May!

      Ate there in March for a birthday celebration and was NOT disappointed.  This place is great and highly recommended.  The ambience is great. You do walk through a rather long narrow bar area, but when you get to the main dining area, you will be impressed. Great views of the strip.  We were seated in a very private booth with floor to ceiling "booth" - it was intimate and allowed the 6 of us to really talk.    The service - attentive.  Not overbearing, not pushing (i..e we weren't that hungry and didn't order apps).  The breadbasket - yummy!!!!!   Several tried the black cod - delicous!! I had the duck - it was wonderful and cooked just right.  Portions are on the smaller side, so if you are hungry make certain you order an appetizer.  The entrees were mostly in the $30 range, though some a bit cheaper.  They brought a lovely molten chocolate lava cake thing for the birthday boy, which was really tasty.  The wine list is huge! Not cheap, but some good selections.  Overall - certainly a place I would return.

      So, I was in Vegas for a fab Race/Scavenger Hunt event, and met up with friends the night before the event at Scarpetta for what I hoped would be an excellent meal.  It did not disappoint.  There were some nice-sounding appetizers on the menu, but we bypassed those in favor of ordering the day's pasta special as our starter.  it was linguini with truffle, and it was perfect.  Possibly the best pasta I've ever eaten.  Seriously, I wish I'd ordered that again as my meal.  And then maybe again as dessert.  Table faves included the aged sirloin, the orata rossa, the scallops and the sunchokes.  The roasted baby carrots were also pretty great.  The spaghetti was fine, but, honestly, after that starter, it just couldn't compete.  The gingerbread-pear crisp was the fave dessert, though all were good.  The fave wine of the night was the super tuscan, though it was crazy with sediment (something I'm surprised they didn't notice before serving it).

      Great view, good food, we had family style, and we were a bit hurried, but the service was great, and the food was good, Im not sure I gave it a full run through, as we were headed out for the night, the service was good, its small and can feel a little crowded, but overall, id try it again.   I did NOT dig the Cosmopolitan Hotel, we went to my friends suite, and it was unimpressive, and the night club scene was for a bunch of wannabee 23 yr olds.

      This is my first ever check-in on Yelp!  I had a great dining experience at Scarpetta. The food was beyond delicious. The service was terrific and the view was breathtaking. We sat right next to the window so we got to watch the Bellagio water ballet as we munched on our perfectly cooked pasta and veal medallions.   We ordered the braised short ribs with farro and the tuna rolls as our starters. The tuna rolls were not impressive but the quality of the tuna was great. The braised short ribs with farro was so good I could've eaten bowls and bowls of it. The beef was flavorful and tender and the farro was cooked to perfection. I wish we ordered another plate of the short ribs because I loved it. I ordered the famous spaghetti and it was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. The pasta was so fresh, soft and chewy. It was simple but done perfectly. My friends ordered the tortellini with duck and foie gras, veal medallions and fresh pasta sheets with lobster, garlic and pistachios. Everything was delicious. For dessert, we ordered the napoleon with creme brulee and blood orange sorbet.   Our server was attentive and not pushy. He also had a great sense of humor.    It was a great experience over and I would recommend you stop by this place when you're in Vegas.

      I been to the Scarpetta in Beverly Hills, was a bit disappointed in the food there but decided to give this one a try.  GOOD CHOICE! I loved the venue, on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo, mid dark light very elegant, though it is a bit more crowded due to the small space, but the bar area is very cute.  We got 4 diff appetizers, beet salad, pork belly, scallops and Beef I liked them all  Then 4 entrees: black cod, foie gras ravioli, diff meats ravioli and i forgot the last one! but again it was delicious, the black cod melts in your mouth!  Different we got an apple pie sort with ice cream and raspberries.  Def coming out here again next time  invegas. Cosmo is just beautiful and elegant hotel very modern, but trying STK next time
