      This restaurant deserves 4 stars- but we caught them three days after  opening and they are working out the kinks. It took us close to 1/2 hour to get our drinks. Very chic and modern lay out. One of our tapas came first and the wait staff is just out of sync. The lobster Pallea was out of this world and the calamari was excellent. The only miss is the fact that they don't give you any bread to soak up the delicious sauces. After the first round of traditional sangria we went for the white cava fish bowl which packs a good kick and is crisp and refreshing.  It went very well with the monkfish. On the other hand, the food was so phenomenal that after we were full, we saw a tapa dish at another table and still ordered it and desert. Lastly we ordered the flan and the tangerine custard came with a sherbet, whip cream and a couple of slices.  It was fantastic!!! It is in the new Cosmopolitan hotel which is so high tech that you have a tough time finding the east valet, do yourself a favor and park in the west valet. East is a mess and took over 30 min to find our car.

      the mister and me SO wanted to love this place. after all, it was our BIG NIGHT OUT, meaning it was the first time EVER that we were sans canine responsibilities, having left our assorted furry posse members back in not so sunny los angeles.   BUT, this was just an okay experience. dishes ranged in both effectiveness and price, but what unified them was the teensy portions. i understand that tapas means 'small plates', but the price-to-portion ratio needs to be improved (going to Pinks an hour after leaving jaleo--not a good sign--but that's another review).   so here's what we ordered and how it was:   the mister--the lobster salad for $18.00. came with 4 claws of lobster meat on escarole with shaved grapefruit slices. according to the mister, the lobster was perfection, but the escarole was super salty. this i verified--these greens were tragically oversalted. i informed the waiter of this, but he did not offer to rectify the situation.   the mister--chorizo wrapped in potato for $8.00. now the mister really liked this, though he thought it needed more potato. each chorizo was wrapped in a super thin potato chip.   me--sliced apple and fennel salad with sherry vinaigrette and walnuts (minus the manchego cheese) for $9.00. perfection! a burst of starry eyed delight. impossibly fine slivers of fennel and apple. but SUCH a wee portion! seriously, i doubt if there was more than a cup of finely slivered veggies in there!   me--warmed brussels sprout salad with diced apricots for $9.00. it was okay, but again, a super small portion. and again--oversalted. oversalted and not so special. i've made more unique brussels sprouts salads at home.   service was okay. they had some kitchen mix ups but hey, it was day four for the restaurant.

      The BF and I were checking out the new Cosmopolitan when we noticed Jaleo. We are from LA and absolutely love Jose's The Bazaar, so how could we say no?   The place was packed when we got there at 9:30 p.m. on Monday. They are only open for dinner and service begins at 5:00 p.m. We were lucky enough to sit at the foosball table, which the hostess told us was Jose's table! (Although this is unverified.) I have to warn that you become subject to a lot of attention when you sit at the foosball table, because people were looking at us all night! One guy even wanted to take a picture.  The food was nothing short of what you would expect from Jose. It is so creative, inventive, and delicious! My favorites were the vegetable paella with sea urchin (which was on the house; the waitress said that the chefs were making it for everyone in the restaurant to share!), the fried egg with bread crisps and black truffle, and the piquillo pepper stuffed with crabmeat. The housemade sangria ($15 for half a pitcher) was really light and refreshing.  I didn't have any problems with service; our waitress was really down-to-earth and lovely. I think one of the best services I've had. Even though it just opened, it seemed to flow seamlessly (for us at least). The food came out within reasonable times and they gave us their full attention. I'm definitely coming back next time I'm in Vegas. The paella is a MUST!

      My wife and I had dinner here a day after eating at China Poblano.  We loved the overall ambiance of the restaurant. It was modern and fun without being stuffy and serious. We had about 6 tapas including the lobster paella. Everything was tasty especially the chicken fritters, garlic shrimp, squid, and paella.   We liked how they showcased the traditional paella kitchen with gigantic paella pans and wood burning pit.  We can't wait to try all the other tapas...maybe they will open another Jaleo in L.A.?

      This place is pretty high on my sh*t list. The food was delicious but the service was SHOCKINGLY bad. The waiter forgot to bring two of our dishes. When I got sick of waiting and pointed it out to him, he was like "umm, and which dishes might those be?" Really, you don't even know? Even after we informed him, it took forever to get the food - and it was just sauteed mushrooms and spanish omelette. We didn't get out of dinner until after midnight - the entire restaurant was empty! No apologies or anything. It was our last night in Vegas and I was hoping to spend a relaxing evening with my husband. Instead I got to sit around a stupid restaurant waiting for food. You guys seriously need to get your sh*t together.

      This is not a restaurant for good food, let alone good Tapas.. It is more for people watching. Great ideas with presentation (tapas in a shoe??) and seating, however the food was poor and the portions were very small.  The Paella for example was maybe 1 cup.  What happened to Paella being serve in the pan it was cooked in???? For the price you are paying there are so many other great choices in Vegas. Sorry Jaelo... I would give you no stars if I could.

      Tapas is great, it's fun and you can order a bunch of different things and share it with everyone at your table. Semi small orders that are reasonably priced for a high scale tapas restaurant. Some of my favorites were the gazpacho with tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers, the liquid olive dish was amazing!.. I could probably eat a whole plate of just that. The fried dates in bacon were delicious but the presentation was unappetizing. (Order it and you'll see) Not EVERYTHING that we ordered was 5 stars but there were a few that were absolutely delicious and I will definitely be going again and trying the rest of the things on the menu. I hope that I can try at least every dish on that menu at least once! Already planning my next trip to eat here!

      I love cheese and I love wine! Five cheeses for twenty dollars that we nibbled on throughout the whole meal, seemed like a good deal to me. It was served with crusty bread with a delicious spread of crushed tomatoes. Did I mention I also love tomatoes?  I just happened to look right now at the Jaleo Washington DC menu and you get all six cheeses for 18 dollars. Grrrrr! haha, oh well. I've lived in DC and now in Vegas, and I guess this is the compromise I get for dining in a casino on the strip now. My favorite favorite favorite dish that we tasted was the fried organic egg topped with caviar! YUM! YUM! YUM! We also had the spicy chorizo wrapped in a thin potato! Which I thought was great, just the right amount of spice! Then there were the fried dates wrapped in bacon.....hmmmm. Served in a shoe!? YES! served in a shoe. I have a picture on my phone that I wish I could upload right now. I've never eaten out of a shoe before. But, if you can get past the bizarre notion, its actually quite funny (especially after three glasses of wine) and quite tasty! As far as meat goes, I didn't try any of the serrano ham, which I'll have to come back for. But, I loved the grilled hanger steak with piquillo peppers. It was sliced very thin, but still medium rare, and tasted amazing alongside the bread and cheeses. My least favorite was some other roasted red pepper dish, but obviously I can't even remember the ingredients so it did not impress. I was far too full for dessert, but instead enjoyed a cup of resh french press coffee to keep me going for the rest of the night.  The Cosmopolitan is a really fun, new casino and is very beautiful inside; and this restaurant was definitely the place to be in there. Very vibrant and a scene to see and be seen in, alongside delicious tapas. Can't really go wrong with that! :)

      I am a fan of Jose Andres and always look forward to his cooking.   The food was great, the service was good and the atmosphere was light and outgoing. The Sangria was very good and refreshing.  Chistorra envuelta en patata frita were tasty and a good starting dish. I would NOT order the papas bravas becasue they were not what i excpected. They are more like lays potato chips.   The garlic shrimp aka  Gambas al ajillo were amazing with the perfect blend of flavors. I totally recommened them.   Needless to say the PAELLA is a MUST. Its very rare to have good authentic paella so dont miss out.   I cant help but laugh everytime people say  that the portains are small. They are not small, they are Tapas......I enjoyed my expernice at Jaleo and had fun order all kinds of dishes.

      We have been to the one in DC, and loved it.  So we definitely wanted to check this place out.  We went with a group, looking for a "light meal."  There were no reservation available, but there is a bar area with high tables that are open first come first serve.  Must have been our night, cuz a six top was available right then!  We split the olives (3 real ones stuff with anchovies and 3 interesting "spheres" filled with the jus, kinda popped in your mouth), squab with foie gras jelly and truffles, lobster paella, garlic shrimp, thinly sliced monkfish, and fried chorizo sausage wrapped in potato.  Everything was tasty.  Perfect for a group, cuz everything came out in small plates, easy to share.  Our favorites were definitely the monkfish and chorizo.    The paella was a little salty (the Asian in me wanted a bowl of white rice to mix in).  It is interesting, cuz they are only offering one paella at any given moment, so even though they list 4 different kinds, you really only have one choice (maybe 2 if you're willing to wait).  There is a foozball table with a glass top in front of the restaurant.  You can eat and play at the same time...  It was my husband's favorite part.  My favorite part was the SANGRIA.  You must get it - YUM.

      Let me preface this by saying that Jaleo still has some kinks to work out, but it has 4 star potential.  If you're vegan, and don't feel like trekking to the Wynn, Jaleo has a ton of tasty vegan(izable) options for you.  I used to live in DC and go to the original Jaleo in my pregan days, so I was very excited to see Jose Andres open a restaurant here!  I went there solo and ate at the tapas bar, which is fun, because you get to watch them make all kinds of little dishes and you can ask the sous chefs about what they're making etc.  Plus the people next to me were very friendly and we had a nice chat.  The atmosphere seems very laid back and conducive to such interactions.  (Note: it's not like a sushi bar; they don't serve you directly.  A server will come up behind you and take your order.)  You would be well-advised to make a reservation if you want to eat there on a weekend night - it was completely packed with a line when I went.  I got the only seat left in the place!  Note: the food here is VERY salty because they use a lot of finishing salts.  If you aren't into that, just request your food with "no added salt."  I had the pan con tomate (tomato bread), espinacas (wilted spinach with apples and shallots), papas arrugas (salted roast potatoes with red and green chile sauces - not spicy though), and the chef brought out a sample of the veggie paella!  I also had apple sorbet for dessert.  (For Bay Area people - they use the same Pacojet technology as Scream Sorbet to make an amazingly creamy vegan sorbet).  Everything was very tasty, if a bit oily and salty.  Very rich!  (I will order w/ no added salt next time.)  The folks next to me shared their sangria, which was very tasty (although not made the traditional way... they add the fruit to your glass rather than macerating in the wine.)  The service was very attentive at times, but hit or miss.  I had a great time and enjoyed my meal and will definitely be back with a group so I can try lots more things!  For you non-vegan foodies, you might wanna check out e, the chef's tasting room at Jaleo.  They do a 20-course dinner (two seatings a night) for ~$150.  They can make exceptions for some dietary restrictions/allergies, but sadly don't do a vegan version (yet?).   Here is a list of the vegetarian/vegan/veganizable dishes:  Pan con tomate -tomato bread Gazpacho - cold tomato soup Manzanas con hinojo y manchego (minus cheese) - apple-fennel salad Espinacas a la Catalana - wilted spinach with sherry dressing and apples Escalivada - cold roasted eggplant and pepper Setas a ajillo - garlic mushrooms Trigueros con romesco - asparagus w/ Romesco sauce Ensalada de coles de bruselas con albaricoques, manzanas y jamon (minus the jamon - ham) - brussels sprout salad Remolacha con citricos (minus the cheese) - citrus/beet salad Papas Arrugas with mojo verde y rojo - roasted potatoes Verdura Paella - Veggie paella (they do not use chicken stock, only water)

      Iv'e dined at many Tapas restaurants in L.A., even to Firefly in Vegas, but this is by far my new favorite. My sister and I went to Jaleo yesterday and had a visual and taste sensory overload. The ambiance is lively yet intimate, the food authentic yet familiar, and the desserts..omg, the Flan and the Pan Con Chocolate were out of this world.  The best tasting tapas were: 1. Ajo blanco con cangrejo: Chilled almond and garlic soup with crabmeat and green grapes. -TRUST ME- Just order it and thank me later.  2. Croquetas de jamón Ibérico:  Traditional fritters with Ibérico ham and a bechemel cream sauce.  -Can't go wrong here! 3. Empanadillas de brandada de bacalao:  'Empanada' of cod brandade with honey.  -Oh so heavenly 4. 'Esqueixada':   Salad of salted cod with black olives and fresh tomato  -It's not really a salad, more like a dip that comes w/ rustic bread. This was absolutely spectacular, despite the fact that i'm not even a huge fish fan. 5. Canelones tradicionales de cerdo, hígado de pato y trufas con salsa bechamel:   Pork, foie gras and truffle canelones with bechamel sauce. - It  tastes as good as it sounds. 6. Jamón Ibérico de bellota Fermin:  Cured ham from the legendary, acorn-fed, black-footed Ibérico pigs of Spain  - We also got the cheese plate which went very well with our Sangria ;)  7. Mejillones en escabeche:  Mussels marinated in Sherry vinegar - They serve it in a sardine can w/ olive oil and herbs..they melt in your mouth 8. Endivias con queso de cabra y naranjas:  Endives, goat cheese, oranges and almonds -  fun and refreshing  9. Ensalada de coles de Bruselas con albaricoques, manzanas y jamón:  Serrano Warm Brussels sprouts salad with apricots, apple and Serrano ham- its one of their most popular dishes... They have a huge selection of Paella as well, but we were too full by then.  Btw, their Sangria is stronger than you'll think!

      Tapas, yes, I know means small/little dishes, but I think they took this to the extreme. Where are all these reviewers from? Were they blinded by the lights on the Strip?!? Because, I could barely see the food on the plate.  The main issue I have with Jaleo is the small portions. $7 for a plate of potato chips with red and white sauce drizzled, my coworkers make this at lunch in the lunch room, its called lays with sirracha and onion dip drizzle. We ordered to our hearts content but our stomachs were far from filled.  Don't get me wrong, I understand quality over quantity, but if you really break it down, give me an endless supply of the minuscule tapas, so small I can barely remember what I ate, I still wouldn't come here. The plates are small (yes for the 4th time in this review, not sure if I got my point across), but the quality of the tapas are not even that great or anything spectacular. The entire dinner, I couldn't stop thinking about the cup-o-noodle I purposely didn't eat because I didn't want to spoil my appetite, bad move.   This place is not good for groups, seeing as you have to order at least 3-4 orders of each tapa to feed a table of 9-10. One star for the creative serving style, putting deep fried bacon covered dates in a shoe, fooseball tables doubling as a dining table, and decent service is about all there is to rave about here. There's no reason to eat here when superior "foodie-esq"restaurants with big name chefs are a dime a dozen in Vegas.

      In the midst of the insane opulence of that which is the Cosmopolitan, lies an equally over the top experience at Jaleo. Located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo is a mix of amazing places to eat with Jaleo holding up the growing Tapas category. The entrance to Jaleo is inviting and enticing and holds a level of energy not seen by most eateries on a Tuesday evening. Just walking in and sitting at the bar, I knew we were in for a treat. Just as the rest of the Cosmo, no level of detail went underlooked inside this Spanish Tapas endevor. From the Tapas Kitchen mid dining room, to the wood burning circle kitchen right next to the bar, Jaleo's let's you marvel in the mastery of culinary design by seeing how it's made right before your eyes.  At the bar, we ordered two drinks, I had a Tomato infused something or other that was out of this world, very pricey for the serving size, but worth having at least once. My friend ordered a glass of champagne which was also good I was told, but also on they high side for price vs. Volume. That aside, it was time to order. We got the Bacon Wrapped Dates, the Potato Chips with white and red sauce, Chirizo Wrapped with Potato chips, White Asparagus, and the Conejo (Rabbit).  To make this easy, I'll simply break it down: Bacon Wrapped Dates: A typical order for us from Firefly, so we wanted to compare. The presentation was definitely not what we were expecting, but very fun to experience. They come served in a tennis shoe from a brand that we were told is the "Adidas of Spain". Aside from the off the wall plating, the Dates were amazing. The difference is, they deep fry the bacon wrapped dates so the whole bite is moist and flavorful with more of a hint of bacon and the richness of the date compared to most places where the bacon wins the flavor battle. A+ Potato Chips with Red and White sauce: A simple dish with lots to love. The chips seemed freshly made and the sauces had a good contrast to each other. Being so fresh, the chips had less crunch than you'd normally expect, but I saw it as a good thing. Not mushy, just less crunch and more smooth textures. B+ Choirzo Wrapped in Potato Chips: Simple, yet delightful. It is what it is, delicious Spanish chorizo, fresh potato chip, and a toothpick. Pick it up, bite, and enjoy. Simplicity at it's best, and tastiest. A White Asparagus: This was served inside a sardine-can-like tin sprinkled with a bit of cheese. The fresh crunch of each bite, cut by the slight bitterness of the cheese made each tiny serving seem like so much more. A Conejo (Rabbit): Something that's definitely not on everyone's top choices to try, but should. This was a leg and ribs serving with an apricot compote that was light and rich with enough sweetness to nicely balance the supreme flavors of the juicy Rabbit. If you've never tried Rabbit before, this is the one to try. It is not off putting at all, and will make you wish you could have it every day if you could! A+ To finish us off, we figured we'd indulge and have the Chocolate Hazelnut Cake. What a work of art this dessert was. I would've paid for just one bite of it. The chocolate and hazelnut combination they use is an absolute marrige commencing on your pallet. It was so good, I'd go there to just order that! A+ I thank the Cosmopolitan for choosing such an outstanding Tapas joint. I can't wait to try more of the menu. Hopefully over time, Jaleo's gets a happy hour or local's night, but even until then, this will be my new place to enjoy Tapas with friends and family.

      Having been to The Bazaar by Jose Andres and loved it, I was excited to try some of his more traditional fare.  Overall, I thought this meal was fun and an overall success.  We came here on a Sunday night without reservations but were seated right away as a table had just become available.  This is off to a good start!  We started with the Aceitunas ($12 for 4 anchovy stuffed green olives and 4 kalamata olive spheres made from sodium alginate).  I've had Jose's black olive spheres at the Bazaar and actually thought the kalamatas work much better.  Next, we had the Chistorra Envuelta ($8 for 6 skewers).  The spicy chorizo  was quite tasty and contrasted perfectly with the crunchiness of the potato chip wrapped around the  skewer.  The waitress highly recommended the Gambas al Ajillo ($10 for 6 shrimps) which the menu features as one of their most popular dishes.  Maybe it was high expectation from the waitress and the menu, but I thought the shrimp wasn't really anything special.  Sure it was perfectly cooked, but it just tasted like nicely cooked shrimp with garlic oil.  My favorite dish of the night was easily the Pinchon Estilo Alcantara which was squab topped with foie gras and shaved black truffle ($22).  All the flavors came together so well.. I would have ordered this plate just for myself.. who says sharing is caring?  The Rape a la Donostiarra ($10 for a large platter of thinly sliced monkfish) was pretty solid.  The waitress said it was a brave dish.. I've never had monkfish prepared this way before, but didn't think it was anything overly eccentric.  Finally, we had the Arroz a Banda con Bogavante ($28) which is their lobster paella.  I was really looking forward to this, since we were sitting right next to the paella station.  As a quick note, they only serve 2 paellas at any given night, and could take up to 30 minutes to prepare, so be aware that not all options are going to be available.  The paella was quite rich and tasty.. a tad over-seasoned, but that's ok.  Each dish is served with half a lobster tail and a claw, which was a nice touch.  We had our meal with a pitcher of red sangria, which I highly recommend.  You can never really go wrong with wine mixed with fruit.  Overall, Jaleo was pretty much what I expected from Jose Andres - tasty, modern Spanish cuisine.  I can't wait to come back to try everything else on the menu.  Definitely come in a group to maximize the selection.  I thought our party of 6 was perfect, since most of the dishes come in groups of 6.  Also, I actually thought the price was fairly reasonable for what we were getting.  4 stars!!

      This place was horrible from the moment  they tried to seat us at a table from barbie's doll house. The waiter was a total jerk he practically ignored us he spoke so low I felt that I was in a Seinfeld episode. They would not make a Paella without lobster my girlfriend is allergic to shell fish. The waiter did not come back and tell us that we would need 5 people to have an order of paella.  I understand that it takes 30 min to an hour for paella. The other items were ok at best there was a shell in our mussels in sherry wine sauce. The only redeeming thing about this place was the manager was nice enough to give us her card for a return visit but why bother. Not local friendly either.

      I had a great dinner at the bar this past Sunday night. The bartender was very friendly and helpful in recommending great dishes. I had several tapas and everything was perfect. From the sea urchin omelette to the foie gras and quail , it was all good. I hightly recomend this restaurant if you love spanish food and if you are in town.

      I have NEVER sent a dish back to the kitchen before but had to at Jaleo. The waitress told us they were out of the lobster paella. We ordered other tapas but 5 minutes later she came back and said "Great news!. We have one more batch of lobster paella we can cook!" Great but... paella takes 45 mintues to cook (she let us know that when we sat down) and it arrived to our table 5 minutes later. Really??? I tried one bite and it was obvious that the paella had been sitting out for awhile under a heat lamp. Proably becuase antoher customer hed already refused it. The food was cold, the plate was cold, and the rice was well-done. I didn't dare try the rubbery lobster. The dishes we ordered afterwards were fine but nothing special. If you want great tapas in Las Vegas, go to Firefly on Paradise where I've always had great experiences with both food and service~!

      The food was okay.  VERY expensive.  Service was atrocious.  Sangria was terrible.  Paella was spat out by all who tried it.  Dried out rabbit with lots of pinbones.  Bleccch.  They make the sangria to order so you get to see what's in it.  Cheap red wine, a little brandy, and a slice of orange.  $10?  Really.  This was unlike any sangria I've ever had.  Undrinkable  It was the service that really torpedoed our experience here, though.  It took us a half hour to get our first round of drinks.  We had to flag down the manager and have hime take our order.  Our server was a frazzled mess.  He was staring at the computer in the service station literally the whole night.  I got his attention at one point and asked if I could order a drink.  We were a group of 8 and no one had a drink yet.  I asked for a glass of tempranillo and he took off without taking anyone else's order.  Another member of our party managed to flag him down 10 minutes later and he tried to do the same thing!  Take one more person's order then fly away.  TAKE EVERYONE'S ORDER AT THE SAME TIME!  It was insane.  We spent well over a thousand dollars for 8 people.  I've eaten at Bazaar in LA, Jose Andres' other west coast foray into high-end tapas and it was one of the greatest meals I've ever experienced.  This place was a real let down.  There was so much that was wrong.  The fried dates in a shoe on the table.  Not cute or appetizing.  The sangria was absolutely awful.  Service was non-existent.  We wanted to order dessert but didn't have time since it took us so long to order and receive food and drink.  Paella inedible.  The room was way too bright.  I can't really even convey with words how sucky our meal was and how ripped-off we felt when we got the enormous bill.  The manager heard us grumping about the meal and didn't offer anything to try to turn the tide of negativity.  I think he was used to it.  Most other tables in our vicinity seemed disgruntled.  One table walked out ant the manager tried to get them to pay for the food they ordered and never got.

      I know that Jose Andres is a very talented and incredible chef, and this location inside the fabulous, newly opened Cosmopolitan will improve over time. I love tapas and Jaleo has done a good job at creating some delicious dishes.  Off the top of my head, the pan con tomate (tomato bread), endibias conqeso (endives with goat cheese, oranges and Almonds) and the garlic shrimp were wonderful...include the pitcher of sangria and the evening was a memorable one.  The only bad item was one they take some much pride in...paellas, and this evening they happen to feature the lobster paellas. The lobster was grilled to perfection and very delicious, however the paellas was very crunchy...possibly undercooked al dente-style. And nothing is worse than crunchy rice.  Sad, as I was really looking forward to this.  The server got extremely busy as the restaurant started to fill, but a host overheard our dissatisfaction and gladly offered to remove it from the final bill.  It gets real busy at 8:00, so unless you book ahead, you could be sitting outside watching others enjoying their meal.  Again, with a little more time to work out some kinks, and an opportunity to closely monitor the food quality, this will be a great place to impress friends.  Already The Cosmopolitan has built the visually-pleasing infrastructure.

      ATMOSPHERE // The environment itself is quite top notch, but that's more of a compliment to the hotel, not the restaurant. The slick idiosyncrasy of The Cosmopolitan continues through Jaleo. I loved all the design details from the typographic front gates to the piecework bull mounted on the wall and chicken tots served in a shoe (surprisingly cute and not gross idea). If you're lucky enough to have arrived with good company as I did, the restaurant's open layout and interesting tidbits allows for a good night of rousing conversation. My own party aside, I found the dining staff to be quite full of themselves, or rather, brainwashed by the supposed amazingness and sadly mislead by what a standard portion size is. I give them part of the blame for setting false customer expectations.  FOOD // The food really fell short of 3-stars. I've been to different small-plate kind of eateries before and Jaleo neither measured up for it's priciness in ingenuity nor taste. We took a while to figure out what to order because we were informed by our group of comrades who had a reservation before we did that the portions were fantastically small and the food not all that great. One friend honestly, and repeatedly, told us to get up and flee the place before it was too late. Could it really be that bad? sangria :: This was a good choice. Served with fresh slice of citrus, chunk o' watermelon, and some mint. And one will need some amount of vino to make up for everything else.  lobster paella :: We expressed concerns about hunger satisfaction so the waiter suggested the paella as a good way to fill up. The lobster paella had good flavors, but was rather salty (like most of the food).  fried bacon wrapped dates :: Bacon wrapped anything is always good and ever better when it's deep fried.  chicken fritters :: They're like tater-tot sized pot pies.  garlic soup :: This was the worst. It tasted like you took the packet of Chicken Top Ramen seasoning and poured it into a cup of lukewarm water and then dropped an egg in there. The waitress gushed about how the egg is cooked at exactly 63 degrees and gave me a stony stare when she caught me rolling my eyes. I apologize that your soup sucked.  chilled almond &amp; garlic soup :: Interesting combination of flavors. Much better than the other soup, but that isn't saying much.  kurobuta pork jowls &amp; scallops :: I ordered this and it was microscopic for $14. A few slivers of unmemorable pork and maybe half a scallop total. I can get this for $6 at a Japanese izakaya.  desserts :: We ordered 3 with components like olive oil ice cream, flan, and chocolate mousse. Again, nothing I think is worth mentioning. Do we sense a pattern?  All in all, the food didn't impress me in any way, especially factoring in the price and portion size. We had a party of 7 and with 2 carafes of sangria, 3 paellas, plus about 10 small plates, it ended up being $51/person. Jaleo is like dating a rich bitch: she may look nice and spout esteem, but it's all shallow and will set you back more money than it's worth. If you're looking to settle down for a better meal, check out the pretty girl next door to the strip instead at Firefly [http://www.fireflylv.com/].

      I went to Jaleo with a co-worker for dinner on Thurs, Feb 10, 2011. I have been to Bazaar (Jose Andres' restaurant in Beverly Hills) a few times so I kind of new what to expect. I would say I got pretty much what I expected.  The atmosphere is really nice. The Cosmo Hotel is very new and contemporary and Jaleo continues that feel. The restaurant is live and has a very fun, energetic atmosphere. There is an open-ness to the restaurant and it blends in with the rest of the hotel (so that you don't feel closed off).  The food (as with other Jose Andres restaurants) does not live up to the hype. The food is definitely not bad, but it is basically slightly above average. I love the tapas (small plates) style of eating, because you can try many dishes. And when you look at the menu, there are sure to be several things that look extremely appetizing.  The two of us had about 6 or 7 dishes. The cones filled with salmon sashimi and topped with salmon roe were very salty. I was expecting those to be better, they were just okay.  The Brussels sprout salad was pretty solid. We had a monk fish dish which was pretty good, it had a cilantro oil on it.  The bacon wrapped dates were very tasty. I have had bacon wrapped dates at many other restaurants, the difference here is that they were lightly breaded and deep fried. I though that was a nice touch. However, at other places bacon wrapped dates are stuffed with cheese (either a hard cheese like a Parmesan or sometimes a blue cheese). Here no cheese, and adding a nice Parmesan would kick it up a notch.  The veal cheeks were very good in my opinion.  We had a couple other salads including the lobster salad. Probably too much lettuce compared to the other goodies.  We also had the vegetable paella (which was the special) and it was pretty much vegetable paella. It was on the more expensive side (around $18) of the dishes and was not worth it. I would rather have had 2 more interesting dishes.  In the end, I would recommend this restaurant to others because the experience is worth it. The atmosphere and the unique dishes make for a fun time. Keep in mind, the dishes at this restaurant are not as "wild" as Bazaar where he uses several techniques some refer to as molecular gastronomy. But, the dishes are interesting and very palatable. Just don't go in expecting Michelin star quality food and you won't be disappointed.  Price is fairly reasonable for this type of setting. The dishes ranged from about $8 - $20 per dish. Typically looking at about 6 dishes for 2 people.  Enjoy.

      Jaleo is the third place I have been to at the Cosmopolitan. I had been wanting to try it from the day it opened; the Iberico ham was calling my name!  My wife and I made our reservation through Opentable for Android and got right in at 630pm the day before Valentines. I immediately noticed that this was a "hipster" type of place with a modern feel; Wood floors and white tables without table clothes. The feeling was comfortable while retaining its coolness. If you are expecting a romantic, quiet, and private atmosphere this is not the spot for you.  The Menu is expansive and playful. Chef Andres' uses a nice sense of humor on his menu to get you to eat and drink! Most of the dishes are tapas style and this encourages sharing of course! We started with the Iberico Jamon bellota from the famous black footed pig! it's a little pricey at 22$ for five shaved slices, but go for it; you can't get this stuff in a supermarket.  Next, we ordered the Soupa De Ajo which is garlic soup with a 63degree Egg. They served it tableside and it was Soo garlicky and delicious! The croutons melted right in front of you as the hot soup hit them. The soup was soul satisfying!  Following the soup we had Dungeoness crab stuffed peppers. Tasty but not monumental. Then we got the foie gras and pork cannoli's in bechamel! Wow! Yummy! Topped with shaved black truffles this dish satisfies the biggest foodie! Rich and creamy and savory; everything you could want in a dish. We didn't think that our next dish of Veal cheeks could stand up, but the cheeks were out of this world! Luscious and tender you could eat them with your fork and served on the most wonderful olive oil potatoes you could ever want. The pork and the potatoes together were heavenly. This was our absolute favorite dish!  The night we were there the paella was made with Lobster. We went for it! As I said before, the chef is cute with his menu. So to me this seemed to be his signature dish. When you walk in to the restaurant you see a huge grill surrounded by UFO sized Paella pans.  I figured if you go to Jaleo then you have to try this dish. They tell you the paella takes about 45 minutes so it actually came out after our veal cheeks. Perfectly cooked lobster rested on top of the rice. This dish was all about the rice and the seafood with a yummy garlic aioli on the side. My only problem with the dish was that the Lobster was still in the shell. I have a problem with a place that serves lobster in the shell. I don't want to wrestle the damn thing to eat it. but it was a lovely dish and very good.  Our two desserts were well done and tasty but the dessert menu is short; only about 8 choices. Save some room and share like the rest of menu!  The service was very attentive! Our water glasses were never empty and there was never a pile up of empty plates. The table remained clean and cleared throughout the dinner. Our waitress, Michelle, was helpful in selecting a nice Rose Cava that went very well with all the food. Even on a busy night they were really on top of the service.  Overall I would recommend Jaleo to anyone who is into good food. I would definitely return for more!

      I love tapas restaurants, so I was excited to try Jaleo in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  The atmosphere is much like the Cosmopolitan itself: trendy, popular, and loud.    We had a group of five and ordered 3 plates each to share.  These were by far the smallest plates of tapas I've ever seen.  Some barely had enough to pass around once.  Plus, the tiny plates were way over-priced.  Some dishes were better than others, but really nothing was great.  We liked the ponche de cava, the croquetas, and the apple salad, but none of the entrees were good.    The restaurant was loud and crowded and we kind of got lost in the shuffle a few times.  The service was very spotty - sometimes they took away our plates before we had finished, and sometimes they left us sitting for way too long before checking on us. The server said she would put all our tapas in an order that made courses, but that made it so some people didn't have anything they wanted to eat for a course or two.  Also, our check did not come until we asked the manager to track it down for us.     In all, I would probably not return to Jaleo.  Part of the fun of tapas is enjoying the people you are with.  This restaurant makes it hard to enjoy the company of your dinner companions due to the crowded and loud environment.

      Love Jaleo! The first time I went was with some girlfriends and the second time was with a larger group for a friend's birthday. Both visits were fantastic. I liken Jaleo as the Comopolitan's version of Firefly. The tapas are delicious. Some of my favorite eats:  -bacon figs -manchengo bread -oysters -croquettas -paella (they generally only have two available on a given night and there is a man dedicated to just cooking paella, it's cool to watch) -sangria  Have dinner here and then head over to chandelier bar for a cocktail :)

      I love tapas and not only is my best friend a chef at the blue ribbon sushi grill but I also had a friend who works at jaleo so I went on a recommendation from them both.   Me and another girlfriend went to jaleo for dinner and all I can say is the service that we got from some white guy named Brian was horrible. We understand that being in the cosmo it was busy but he did not once ask us how the food was, and was too busy with the couple next to us. He was too occupied with getting more money out of that couple than giving us decent service. Our food came out relatively fast but everything that came out was bland. By the end of our meal we were craving some flavor, hoping to get dessert.. It took us 20 minutes to get our check and not only that he didn't even offer us a dessert menu.  We had gotten the shrimp al ajillo, the chicken fritters, the chorizo wrapped in potato, and the tuna salad. All were bland and the portions were minuscule to almost non existent. I know tapas are meant to be small, but jaleo took it to the next level.  I was furious when I left, the food was sub-par and the service was ridiculous. I would have complained to the manager if I wasn't in such a hurry to get out of the godforsaken place. I will never go back to jaleo, I'd rather go to firelfy where the service is decent to amazing and the food is always out of this world. After leaving we were asked where we had dinner that night and both me &amp; my girlfriend blanked. The service was that horrible that we both couldn't even remember the name of the restaurant.

      i have eaten at the Jaleo in DC and LOVED it.  so i was excited to visit the Jaleo in Vegas.  i was disappointed to say the least.  the service was horrible...we had reservations and didn't get seated for almost 40 minutes.  and no one apologized even when we voiced our impatience.  the service continued to get bad.  we didn't see our waitress for almost 20 minutes and didn't get our water glasses filled for almost that long as well.  the server forgot to put our order in for the paella and it was at our table an hour after we ordered it.  and once it came to the table it was cold, overseasoned, and crunchy.  the couple next to us kept getting the wrong dishes from our server.  i would excuse the poor service if the food was out of this world.  everything was oversalted or overseasoned.  with the exception of the spinach salad which was completely bland.  i hope Jaleo gets with the program.  i am a big fan of Chef Andres' restaurants and i want to see him succeed.
