      Cool place to visit, you can take the tram to other casinos and the hotel was built like the Tribeca Grand Hotel or vice versa. Must visit.

      As over the top as Donald's combover.  I didn't know the Egyptians had casinos in their pyramids! Very much a theme place. Send the less casino-excited to this destination to at least experience the various theme-based activities. Ride down the Nile. Explore a tomb...

      I remember coming here when it first opened and being so amazed by everything being so big and hi-tech! Now it's just another theme casino to me. With that said, it's a great place for families with kids. Check out King Tut's tomb, ride down the Nile, watch some IMAX movies, search for the obelisk, play in the arcade. Oh, those were the days.

      I liked this hotel, but I wouldn't say that it was the nicest hotel on the strip by any means.  We had a non-smoking room in the pyramid, which was kind of cool.  The room was pretty regular (no special perks) and there was no amazing mall, like there are in some casinos.  All in all, probably the least desirable of the high end casinos on the strip.

      Cool hotel. The rooms weren't too expensive (~100/night over a holiday weekend), and the onsite amenities were pretty nice. $20/day for use of the health club is pretty steep, but the package includes a lot. A bit far south on the strip, but not too distant from anything else.

      I come here for the cheap rooms and relatively quiet atmosphere of the pyramid.  It's a nice alternative to the packed and chaotic clubs of other resorts and the service is always pretty good.  Check out their off peak season room rates and stay here for under $40 a night!

      While the Luxor isn't the most extravagant hotel on the strip, it's clean, nice, and affordable.  Also a neat thing, their elevators or "inclinators" go up and down on a diagonal.

      Definitely cheaper priced rooms at this hotel. Fairly basic and no-fuss room but nothing luxurious, after all, you only pay about $50-60 during off-peak times. Rather quiet and laid-back atmosphere and very spacey lobby area.

      For a hotel on the strip, this place is worth the price.  I stayed in the pyramid room, and the room was much larger than I expected.  The noise from the casino did not travel up, so I could sleep without being distrubed.   My newphew and niece liked the swimming pool.  Plus it is adjoining to the Mandalay Bay, where the gambling is fun.

      They should change the name to the SUXor because this place sucks. Snotty desk staff will take your 20 and still look at you as if you just took a dump on their counter, plus you will get NOTHING from them, so save your money and don't tip the desk staff expecting anything. The rooms are DARK like so dark you can't read a book comfortably. There are no full mirrors in the rooms, no minibar or minifridge. My television was missing a remote control which took 3 calls and 5 hours to rectify. The elevators incline at a very strange angle and it feels like you are on a ride at an amusement park only it isn't amusing. The plumbimg made a clanging noise all night and day  "it's in the pipes". It was like Chinese water torture. The buffet at Pharaoh's Pheast was less than memorable, and don't go by what it says on the main floor, cause quite a few of the items that were supposed to be on the buffet were no where to be found. Also, stay close to your room if you eat here, I was running for the bathroom not long after eating. The internet connection they offer is neither cheap nor reliable as I kept getting disconnected and had to keep logging back in.  There are many other places to stay that look like they are better maintained, this place looks good a first glance, but a closer look will reveal that it is not worth it. I once stayed at the Embassy Suites here, and would go back there before coming back to the Luxor. Actually most people I've spoken with like Alladin, Harrah's or MGM on the strip. Off the strip, the Hard Rock is great as is the Palms. As for the Suxor, well, I've learned my lesson.

      The most affordable near luxury hotel on the strip. You can get rooms for under $150 on weekends which is pretty cheap by Vegas standards. Go with tower rooms 'cos pyramid rooms feel kind stuffy and dark plus you have the pyramid slope which cuts of half the room. The tower rooms are very comfortable. The Luxor pool area is the place to be on a hot summer day. For the price this place is definitely worth it.

      This is the hotel that looks like an Egyptian pyramid, the one you see in all the movies.  It's a nice hotel but we had to go to a tradeshow at Mandalay Bay and the walking through the casinos maze was killer! Also the food court in Luxor was a bit hard to find, we didn't realize there was cheapo McDonald's $1 menu in the food court until the last few days!

      I looove the Luxor. We stay here almost everytime, which is about twice a year. The rooms are inexpensive, and ordering alcohol from the Room Service menu is pretty affordable as far as Room Service prices go. I personally love the decor of the rooms. Pyramid rooms are dark, which I prefer, as it feels more cozy for me.   The jacuzzi suites are little rooms from heaven. The jacuzzi tub is right up against the slanted window, which adds a bit of romance to those late drunken Vegas nights. Sure the water smells of chlorine, but that's to be expected anywhere, right? The suites also come with a fridge. No mini-bar, but again, room service booze is doable. $30 for a bottle of decent vodka beats hunting down a liquor store in town and paying $25. They also offer smaller 2-serving alcohols, with a mixer for around $6-$8.

      Towers(East and West) and the pyramid, I like the tower room much better, near the pools and spa.  The inclinator in the pyramid is interesting the first time then it is just an elevator after that.  The rooms are smaller in the pyramid.  Love the bathrooms, separate, all glass shower, from the deep soaking tub with built in arm rests.  The soaps and scents are from the spa and smell so yummy.   Got some great rates in the past $60-80 a night online with some coupons for the spa, dining and IMAX show.   Love the decor of being in Egypt. King Tut museum wasn't impressive, but free. I remember when they did the barge tour inside the pyramid and that  was weak too.  They closed that one. IMAX ride, In Search of the Obelisk was weak too, there are other movies. $12.  Like to location of being near Mandalay Bay and the tram to it.  Pool is nice, four of them.  One has these huge huge columns with  water spewing from them.  I seem to go when at least one pool is  under construction.  Came here for the long running Blue Men Group, saw it a few times, it  was that good, what they do with twinkies and marshmallows is too  hilarious, let alone pvc piping and neon paint.  You don't want to  sit in the first 6 rows, let me just say, those seats come with rain  jackets.... They have moved to the Venetian.

      This is based on a stay in the pyramid......It's a cool property, but a little bit away from the action.  If you're a drinker, then you probably want to stay in the tower. The inclinator is an elevator that takes you up the pyramid at an angle.  Not only is it not the best thing for a drunk's tummy, but it can be complicated to make sure you're getting into the correct one.

      Luxor has always been a "middle of the road" hotel.  The price is fair, the rooms are "ok" and the serive is good.  It is a cool hotel in terms of the design.  I would recommend if you are a tourist and don't want to spend a ton o cash.

      Best suite i ever stayed in and didn't pay for.  The one thing I miss about working in the music industry are weekends like this. After a week of partying in New Orleans, we decided to hop a plane to Vegas to catch No Doubt play. Of course since we were with the cool crew, rooms were comped and we crashed in one of the Luxor's suites. Good Lawdy Lawd, what a gorgeous space. We were only in it for maybe an hour of the 24 we were there, but what a magical hour it twas :)

      A great hotel for the Price.  The One Club pays off getting your own line for check in.  The Luxor has often been our home base when we stay in Vegas, but it loses a star for long walks when your room is at the furthest end from the "Inclinator"!!

      I don't particularly like this end of the strip; it's all to Disney inspired for me. These hotels are starting to show their age, but the price is usually pretty good, we got out of there for three nights for less than our car rental!

      I'll never get used to those Inclinator (elevator), they make me dizzy. House keeping is slow - It took 3 calls and 35 minutes to get fresh towels. And just like dae m said, this hotel is extermely attractive outside but boring inside.

      and so begin the reviews of the most ridiculous new years i have ever had.  me and a couple friends from college hit up las vegas for new years, and decided to stay in the luxor as it was the cheapest nice hotel on the strip for new years (try $415). the funny part was on the night of the first it was only 109.   when you walk in this place you are speechless. i mean it's a f**king pyramid. the inside can hold a 747 (just the lobby). the rooms are not the nicest on the strip, but to get better you will have to go to venetian, Caesars, bellagio or the wynn, since all the others are pretty much on par with this one.  but its not bad. it has a tram over to the excalibur (so so so so ghetto) and is close to everything.   i personally think the best part is the spotlight shooting straight up in the air from the top of the pyramid. that and the cheap beers they bring you while blowing lots of money at the tables (yeah i'm in debt).   a great place to stay, but there is better. then again there is faaaaaaaar worse.

      The Luxor is my favorite place to stay when I go to Las Vegas. The service has been excellent and everyone was very attentive and polite. The standard rooms are fairly a decent size(3-4 drunk girls lived comfortable in a 2 queen bed room, clothes, shoes, accesories, and all) and the jacuzzi suites are super nice and spacious and can be quite romantic.:) The buffet is not as great as the one at Mandalay but its pretty decent for the price and its not super expensive.  Its a little easy to get lost in the casino but he pool area is really nice but come early on a hot day...I know...I said early..who wants to get up earlier than 1pm right, lol...but come early to get a nice chair and relax.  Its a nice place to stay because its a fairly short walk to NY NY, Excalibur and MGM and its close to the Coke a cola store and the M&amp;M factory place. So I really enjoy staying there.
