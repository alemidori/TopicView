      Spacious, luxurious rooms that definitely merit the 5 Diamond Rating from AAA.  Even if you don't stay at the Bellagio, check out their excellent buffet (brunch and dinner are great) and enjoy the Fountains of Bellagio shows, every night on the half hour from 8 pm to midnight.  Sheer joy.

      The Bellagio is so expensive that it's usually reserved for grand celebrations or the occasional opulent treat. Basic rooms are in the $200-300 range and most gaming tables have a minimum $25 bet. The one time my husband and I were there, we enjoyed lounging in luxurious leather lounge chairs of the fabulous sports bar while watching (and betting and losing) on the SF Giants. But no matter where you are in Vegas, for a cheesy treat, check out the Bellagio fountains, a musical water show that takes place every 1/2 hour during the afternoon and every 15 minutes at night. Spectacular!

      OK, so i'm walking down the strip wondering..."where are all the *cool* people?"  My friends and clients tell me that they go to Vegas, but right now--i'm just not seeing it..... OK so now i'm crusing the pool at Bellagio--Check out the private cabanas...*now* we're talking... some interesting and attractive people hanging out...OK Bellagio that's where it's First Class...was getting a little worried there for a while.

      I usually can't afford to gamble at their table games much here, but their buffet is awesome and worth the price, even if you have to pay the high weekend rates of $33.  Everything is quality from the clam chowder to the Kobe beef.  Giant peeled shrimp are one of my staples here.  Aside from Buffet, the casino is a good spot to relax for $1 keno and free drinks if you are killing time and broke.  Poker room looks classy too.

Yes, hotel services pamper the guests and make sure to help grab tickets to hardest to get into shows. And if you are a Cirque fan, O is housed here. Guests can reserve tickets to shows months in advance. The theaters on premise are astounding. A truly complete place.

      I wish I could just move into the Bellagio; I'd be one of those crazy old ladies who lives in a hotel and wears leopard print. I mean, why would you ever leave this place? You don't even have to go outside to get to a swanky bar, and there's plenty of armoire space for all your stuff.   The Bellagio makes me want to walk around in a makeshift sari and giant sunglasses, smoking a clove and ordering random passersby to "Tuck it in, fatty!!"  I don't even smoke.

      I have to set this up properly.  I've usually stay in five-stars anywhere I go.  For example, I often try to stay in Ritz-Carlton resorts when available (e.g. in Maui, St. Thomas, Amelia Island, etc.) or Grand Hyatt resorts, and so on.  You get the picture.  The Bellagio belongs in the same ranks.  I've been in casinos throughout Nevada and the Caribbean; the casino in the Bellagio is in my top three, easy.  I don't know what else I'd put up there, but the Bellagio is definitely one of the best.

      I only stayed in a standard room, but it felt much larger than a standard room in other hotels.  The bathrooms have both a very large tub (the size of a Jacuzzi tub, but without the jets) and a shower, which doesn't sound like much, but makes a huge difference in a cramped room.  I found the automatic window coverings to be a nice touch, albeit unnecessary.  My only complaint about the rooms would be the lighting--there simply wasn't enough.  I found ironing shirts after dusk to be quite difficult due to low lighting.  Personal taste, I suppose, but not enough to go below a five-star rating.

      The place is decorated beautifully; I stayed around Christmas, which provided additional aesthetic bonuses.  Also, there was a spectacular cafe in the hotel with some of the best baked goods I've ever eaten that (Stephanie M. mentioned this as well).  If I can get the name for it, I will insert it here.  When exiting the casino to the elevators to the main rooms, stay in the main hallway, pass the gift store and it's on the left.  Great for breakfast and the wait is nothing compared to the buffets and other nearby eateries.  Seriously, it had the best croissants I've ever eaten, and I've had my share of them, albeit not in Europe... yet.

      Everything in its right place, pools are majorly used in the summer but somehow magically kept very clean--love that they're all different temperatures, including a cold one wtih a fountain you can swim around, drinks are good, service is great, restaurants in the casino are good but not a good value. Great gelato made in-house and just as affordable as any Berkeley institiution, nice generously sized rooms.

      Love the O show and theatre at this hotel. Beautiful restaurants, romantic garden during all seasons (they change the arrangement and setting every season, Spring, summer, fall, winter - how trendy!) and fountain area, everything is just perfect. Exquisite and extravangant, after all it's Vegas, everything has to be over the top. This hotel has style and it's not cheesy. So much attention to details, from furniture to tapestry and definitely check out the details in the ceilings as well. Who is not to like this hotel??? It's creme de la creme of the entire crop in Sin City!

      Bellagio offers great room rates every now and then, so it is definitely worth while to get on their mailing list. Upgrade to a lakeview room is a must. Though the rooms are not that big (suites are really nice though) the view of the water show in the evenings is spectacular. The conservatory and botanical gardens next to the lobby is extremely beautiful, especially during Christmas time. You must dine at the buffet at least once during your visit. One time I was there with 3 girlfriends and we were at a blackjack table during the wee hours of the morning. The dealer's shift was over, so the pit boss asked us to move over to the next table which only had a single deck. For doing this, we were all given complementary brunch at Cafe Bellagio - a full 4 course meal for all of us!

      It was beautiful but I wasn't blown away.  There was a big, colourful garden that reminded me of the edible one in "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."  I thought the butterfly tent was pretty neat.

      i couldn't help but think, "is this all?" during my stay at the bellagio. i suppose that the service was a bit better than most places (but not extraordinarily so) and the rooms were nicely appointed. but i didn't find myself noticing where the extra bucks i was spending went. the rooms were not very big and finding a cup of coffee and a muffin for less than $10 is an impossibility.   but the desert shop is outstanding!

      the best place for rich men to take you on holiday. i mean, if you must stay in the states and can't get to new york. the best place really would be paris, don't you think? how come nobody's ever taken me to paris?! man, fuck the belagio. furthermore, fuck everyone i've ever dated. this review turned really bad really fast. excuse me while i go cry in the bathroom before my boss gets in.
