      I just experienced a wonderful meal at this establishment. I would say there was a mid-century modern flair to the establishment, with an extremely classy twist. Our server was a gentleman by the name of Eric Baily, and I use the term gentleman loosely...kidding of course, as this man had a great sense of humor, and would truly appreciate a joke as such. He was amazingly attentive.  Our table was also assisted by many other staff members throughout the meal, who were also very helpful and attentive. Everyone was definitely friendly, and seemed excited about the restaurant and what they had to offer. We also spoke with a bar manager for a bit, Luciana, I may have spelt that wrong :(. She had a radiant personality.  They offer a great cocktail and wine list. We tried a key lime martini...yum, and they had Duckhorn Decoy by the glass, for a respectable price...so I had to try it. The bar is beautiful, several stories in height, layered with a beautiful collage of bottles. There was a great open air feel to the restaurant, yet it still maintained a  wonderful level of intimacy.   Then of course comes the food, solid, simple, and of high quality. Judging from my one experience...that seems to be what they are going for. We had a chilled lobster cocktail and oysters on the half shell for starters. Seriously...amazing oysters...I am in the middle of the desert....eating amazing oysters. The lobster was also great. For our mains we had a steak that came out on a 400 degree plate, hot as can be....I know because I touched it, even after I was warned not to ;P Perfect med rare...perfect med rare for sure. My lady had a crab cake dish... a little ballsy to order such a thing coming from living outside of Maryland for some time. Yet...it was much success...top notch fresh crab meat. I guess you gotta thank modern times and next day air, cause everything we tried was super fresh and very tasty. Again, dishes were very simplistic...but with fresh flavors such as that, you'd only be doing an injustice by masking it with complex levels of flavors.

      Mastro's Ocean Club is a gem that you cannot miss next time you're on the Strip.  Located in the newly designed City Center, just look for the beautifully designed "tree house", which hangs high above the ultra chic boutiques in Crystals that only the richest of the rich can actually shop in.  Be sure to request a table inside the tree house...it's where all the cool kids sit.   Mastro's is not cheap, but then again, nothing in Vegas is.  In any case, it's worth every penny because the food is outstanding.  I started off with a very rich and tasty New England Clam Chowder.  For my entree, I went with the porcini mushroom crusted sea bass with fried spinach.  It was light but delicious!! Perfect for lunch.  For the side dish, what else but the lobster mashed potatoes! I'm not talking about lobster flavored mashed potatoes.  No, no, not at Mastro's.  I'm talking about over a pound of lobster mixed in the mashed potatoes.  It was soooo good and was big enough that all four of us could enjoy it with plenty to spare.  Although we were happily stuffed, our waiter brought out their signature butter cake with fresh whipped cream on the side for dessert; with his compliments (a very nice touch, which only further highlighted the tremendous service that we had during our entire meal). I highly recommend getting this dessert no matter how full you are. We all loved it.  I should note that the cocktails were also great.  Make sure you get one of their signature martinis, which comes with dry ice on the bottom of the glass that makes the drink bubble and emit smoke.  Pretty cool.   Although I was able to get a table for four for lunch on a Saturday with ease through OpenTable, that won't last long because the restaurant only opened up 2 weeks ago and the buzz is still building.  Soon, Mastro's will one of the hottest tables in Vegas so get in while you can.

      This place is phenomenal.  Breathtaking when you walk in... just like then 1st time i walked in to XS the nightclub. Absolutely breathtaking.  I had the bone in filet mignon. It was cooked perfectly!!! but honestly it really needs sauce. not the type of steak you can eat by itself. maybe next time ill try ribeye. But with sauce its good.  SEAFOOD TOWER WAS INCREDIBLE!!!! Lobster Cocktail &amp; Oysters were great. They use blue point oysters.  Lobster Mash was good.  For Dessert, the CHOCOLATE PUDDING CAKE WAS THE BEST!!!! Very similar to a Chocolate Lava Cake. Outstanding.  I love this place. Its so beautiful and it really represents living the good life!!!   Service is great. They have like 5 people waiting on your table, bread person, server, drink person. everything. Great great service.  Seating was quick. Probably because City Center is new. I am enjoying it though &amp; i am not looking forward to when this place gets packed. LOVE IT!!! GOTTA TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE EXCLUSIVITY WHILE IT LASTS!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Got to freeload a meal at Mastro's last week. Been to all the Mastro's restaurants except the thousand oaks location so i'm very familiar with their food.   a little surprised by the bar area - kinda small felt a little claustrophobic . Asked for a michelob ultra - sorry , we ran out ...on a tuesday ?!?!?   the restaurant is cool looking but i don't need our waiter to babble on about who designed it, how much was spent, blah blah blah   Let's focus on the food.   Started with the seafood tower - solid . Of course, the pretzel bread - still my fav pretzel bread though CUT gives Mastro's a run for the $$$.   I went for the meat - Bone in rib eye, some creamed spinach and asparagus. Of course, my fav, the blue cheese/oil oil and garlic sauce for the steak ( pic ) ...decent but not to the level of the mastro's in B. Hills and Costa Mesa . The rib eye was also average - the talk about the plate being 400 degrees when it's brought to you - i think they needed to add the 400 degrees to the broiler - i ordered medium but it was rare. more bothersome, it didn't have that nice outer sear bordering on crunch - it was too soft ! flavor was decent.   Some nice pinot noir wines - even though the host gave me the wine list to order, i showed restraint - a Laetitia from Paso Robles and a forgotten Oregon - both under $90 each

      Delicious! We came for "Linner" and I just wish I was hungrier! At Morel's in the Palazzo, we met the most amazing waiter and totally chatted it up with him. He let us know that he also works at Mastro's Ocean Club so we also had to go visit him there...  This restaurant is gorgeous to look at and basically looks like a tree house with the Crystal's shopping area of City Center. It's gorgeous!  We started with amazing cappuccinos in the bar area since our favorite waiter, Dion, was not quite ready yet. I noticed that a cocktail that one girl in the bar was drinking was "smoking"... I think they put dry ice in it for effect!  When we were seated for lunch, we ordered the fried onion strings as an appetizer and the escargot. The bread including "pretzel bread" was a great appetizer too. The onion string serving size was HUGE and could have fed about 8 people. The escargot were in amazing sauce that I dipped my bread into afterward!   Then, I ordered the Cobb salad that came with a generous serving of huge prawns; it was delicious! He had the sea bass with the light bread crumb preparation and it was also amazing! We also shared the house mashed potatoes that included scallions, bacon, etc mixed in and were rich and delicious.   What a fabulous late lunch/early dinner on the way to the airport! It was tough to leave Vegas after an amazing meal like that though!

      Amazing! Incredible treehouse setting, stupendous service and great food. Las Vegas has a new jewel high atop the rather dull Crystals shopping center at the dreary City Center. I can't tell you how wonderful the entire experience dining at Mastro's is--it's magical. Go, enjoy and bring your camera and appetite.

      The food here is pricey, but well worth it. The sides are served family style so you may only need two or three for the whole table. The steaks are perfectly cooked and the cuts of meat are the best of quality.  This particular location offers a cool area to sit in if you are fortunate enough to be seated there. It is a pod-like structure that is in the middle of the hotel atrium. It feels very cool and adds to the experience.  If you are looking to go big, this is a great place to do it!

      In less than 3 months, Mastros is already one of the very best steak and seafood restaurants in Las Vegas.  A truly gorgeous architectural creation.  Don't eat in the bar area; eat in the main room.  They call it the "Treehouse"; I call it the UFO (seems more suitable to the Nevada location!)  I had the 22 oz bone-in ribeye; charred outside; warm and red inside. Quite deliciious. (Envy's bone-in ribeye is a touch more juicy and succulent however.)  The sides: String fries excellent; mac and cheese addictive; mastros mashed potatoes very tasty.  Service is friendly and attentive. Wine list is very good, but not mind-blowing.  I'd go there soon if I were you, because it won't be long before getting a table will be as challenging as getting super-bowl tickets.  A close-to-perfect experience. I just wish they had a local's discount to encourage mid-week action.

      Let me preface by saying we're here for the architecture. As such, it's a 5 star "Treehouse" experience in a magnificently creative space. I felt like we were dining in a modern interpretation of a Jack and the Beanstalk tree house above Superman's Fortress of Solitude. Enough imagery, onward to the food review.  The sea bass was amazing, the cod was very good; but the blackened halibuts were overdone (even the one we had specified medium rare). We also had crab cakes, a lobster bisque, and a salad - all done very well. Sides of creamed spinach and mushrooms were also on cue.  As such,  we made no mention of the less than perfect preparation of the halibut. Yet, a dessert arrived at the conclusion of our dinners, compliments of the house, as if the chef could read our minds. Maybe this is the real Superman's Fortress of Solitude!

      Went there with the girlfriend before Ka. Got the clam chowder to share, she got the maine lobster (mkt price) and I got the round eye steak. We each got a martini.  Clam chowder was ok, we had better at the Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco.  Maine lobster was a bit overpriced but very fresh. 5 waiters came to take out the shell! Girlfriend was amazed Round eye steak was very  generous. Well cooked, and the outside was pretty crispy despite asking for medium rare. Inside was soft and moist as expected. Got the cream spinach on the side. Martinis were very strong and plentiful. Water melon martini was very good. We definitely started to speak more loudly and laughing for no reason after a few full glasses.  Atmosphere overall feels very open, live music is excellent. Waiters were attentive and professional without feeling overwhelmingly present. Girlfriend had a great time so it deserves the 4 stars. Overall, a great experience though a tad pricey, especially the lobster.

      This is the kind of over the top dining that I like to treat myself to once in a while. Gorgeous white tablecloth service, servers in white sportscoats, beautiful bar. I wish I could have spent 3 hours drinking my way through the meal and probably will allow myself that much time next visit.   I had the 12oz bone in filet, it was excellent. Our table ordered the gnocchi &amp; crab as a side dish. Delicious even for $26.    It's a tiny bit awkward that it's in the middle of a massive shopping mall, for this kind of evening I wish I could just put on a nice dress and heels, take a cab and have a doorman open the restaurant door for me instead of trekking through a gi-normous mall up and down escalators to get there. However they make up for it with a cool bar and outstanding service.

      My new favorite steak and seafood house in Las Vegas.  Went again last night and had a magnifcent experience!  The manager, Scott, is a terrific guy. Our server, Sylvia, was charming and attentive. And the food... How about a 32 oz bone-in ribeye!! OMG! (I'm just getting out of the hospital now...had my blood cleaned.)  It was worth it. That's why Crestor was invented.

      Wow, what a great dining experience! It was my boyfriends 21st birthday weekend and I wanted to treat him to something special, and special it was.  We were seated in the "Treehouse" and our server Lionell was the best, he gave us great recommendations and he was very attentive. We shared an order of the tempura shrimp for an appetizer, I had the twin lobster tails, my boyfriend had the new york strip and we shared a side of the creamed spinach. Wow, wow, wow is all I can say. They also brought out a huge slice of chocolate cake after dinner for my boyfriend, something he wasn't expecting, it was a nice surprise and we both really enjoyed it.   The whole experience was great. We will definitely be back, no doubts about that.

      A couple of weeks ago I went to dinner by myelf at Mastro's Ocean Club, the wooden donut shaped eatery located in the middle of the new Crystal's shopping mall at City Center.   It was tempting to fill up on the bread basket filled with pretzel and rye bread sticks, Parmesan crackers, and teardrop sourdough boules, but I restrained myself and saved room for a half order of the Spicy Mambo Salad ($7.99) and the Sauteed Shrimp appetizer ($18.95). Everything at Mastro's is fairly expensive, so these dishes were a great way to test their quality without spending a ton. The Spicy Mambo Salad was essentially a Caesar salad with horseradish in the dressing, and being a huge fan of horseradish, I very much enjoyed it. I always ask for light dressing (or dressing on the side) in less expensive restaurants because more expensive restaurants generally know how to dress a salad properly, and Mastro's was no exception. If anything, the salad bordered on verge of being under-dressed, so if you are a fan of heavy salad dressing, I would ask for extra. The sauteed shrimp were nothing less than wonderful, and hit the spot for my seafood craving. The huge shrimp were cooked just right and served over a broth that tasted like a lobster bisque reduction rich with butter. The cheesy garlic bread croutons absorbed this liquid on one end, but remained crunchy at the other, providing some textural contrast. It was fun to dip all the different kinds of bread from the basket in the sauce as well to see how they each paired differently. Overall it was a really successful dish, and because the shrimp were so plump and the sauce so rich, it was certainly enough for my entree. One item that I might have tried as a side had I been with someone, however, was the lobster mashed potatoes - they looked fantastic. I wasn't too disheartened by not getting them, as I still had a terrific meal that was plenty filling.  I wanted to order their signature butter cake dessert, but because it was $14 and I was full by that point, I decided to pass. I'm sure it's enough for two to three people so maybe next time I go and I'm not by myself I'll splurge and get it.

      Yes I know I am the only person on here to give them 3 stars but please hear me out for my reasoning behind all this.   On Saturday, I had made reservations for a party of two at 730PM. When he arrived at 720PM, it was not really busy nor was it a ghost town in there. The hostess stand said it would be a moment as they got our table ready and for us to take a seat at the bar, enjoy a cocktail or two and they will get us.   During our 30 minute wait (yes maybe they were short staffed, not ready yet etc.... which I am ok with) they sat multiple tables of walk-in's and a few reservations of small 2-4 tops. (I know this because a few sat at the bar whom we spoke to and others I over heard when I stood by the hostess stand to wait to check on my table. Off to a bad start.....   Anyway, we had a nice table overlooking the garden down stairs in the back of the restaurant. All the back-waiters were very prompt and professional with regards to keeping the water glasses full, serving the bread, clearing the table from the right and serving from the left etc... (After working in this industry for years, I get picky about this crap at high end restaurants) The server was pretty on the ball and friendly but a little to relaxed with us. (Yes we are young and eating at a high end restaurant, I am ok with that)  On to the food, below is a list of what we ordered and what I thought about it:   Calamari App: Lightly breaded with light seasoning. Dipping sauce complimented it very well.   Fillet Mignon: Very tender and medium rare is more of rare. But it is better to under cook the steak then burn the hell out of it. VERY TENDER, cut with your fork status.   Sea Bass: Parmesan crusted.... a little on the very fishy side for my taste which overcame the rest of the flavors  Cream of Spinach: Very creamy and just was not my style. Girlfriend liked it though.  Sea salt/vinegar fries: These shoestring cut fries were epic! Yes.... of everything I ate, I was most impressed by the large basket of $10 fries.   Warm Butter Cake: Once again.... this was the main reason we went here for my birthday and because the other half loves this dessert more than she loves me. :)  Multiple layer chocolate birthday cake: Now to be honest, this was what saved Mastro's from getting the dreadful 2-star rating from me. In my reservation, I had noted "birthday" but no one had seemed to see it. Hell, we even ordered desert and were half way finished with it before they brought out the cake. Personally, did someone at the hostess stand go oops! We need to send a birthday cake over to Table XX immediately even though they already are half way through their dessert? But to be honest, they did and it truly made my otherwise mediocre dining experience in to a pleasant one.   Overall Mastros.... maybe I set my expectations to high and I understand, you have only been open for a few months now so maybe all the bugs are still getting worked out. In the words of my girlfriend, it was not as good as the Crystal Cove, CA location yet on par with the one in Costa Mesa, CA.   Sounds like I have to try all this again at the Crystal Cove location and compare! Granted.... thanks for the last minute birthday cake. It was nice to see those little comments on Open Table actually mean something.

      I was on a trip to Vegas on a shopping trip with my mother and my husband demanded that we went to this restaurant.  My mom loved that the restaurant was in a tree-house. Our waitress was very nice and knowledgeable about everything on the menu. We both had the petite fillet, cook amazingly to both our liking. We also had the lobster mashed potatoes (amazing as well). unfortunately, we didn't have room for desert, but it a reason to go back! I even got a phone call the next day asking about my experience which makes me feel valued.

      Went to Mastro's before a show. Scott was our server and was excellent. Had a full dozen oyster's on the half shell which were just out of the ocean fresh and delicious! I ordered Sea Bass blackened and it was melt in your mouth perfect! The lobster mashed were delish as was the house dessert, Warm Butter Cake, served with loads of fresh homemade whipped cream! Servings are large and we all had leftovers. Loved sitting in the treehouse. We do have a few suggestions: The entrance is so boring and the piano is shoved way back in a back corner that you would never notice it. How about putting the piano up front somewhere? Such a wonderful restaurant needs a a better first impression. Also, we had called and asked for a 7:30 reservation and were told it was not available but 8:30 was. That was too late for us to make our show, so reservationist suggested 7. We arrived and were seated at 7 and the restaurant was no more than half full until past 8 pm!! So why couldn't we have come at 7:30 as we first asked? I mentioned this to a manager who approached our table mid-meal  and he said, "Well, sometimes things change." HUH??? Terrible response. Nevertheless, we loved our dinner and the service was fabulous. We can't wait to go back. We're already saving up!

      We went to Mastro's for my friend's birthday dinner.  We were all impressed with the staff - they were very friendly and accommodating (we were 30 minutes late for our reservation).  Our waiter was attentive and made sure we all had our drinks and that the food was to our liking.  Speaking of the food, we loved EVERYTHING!  A few of us ordered steaks (that were cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth!!)  Some ordered fish and they raved about their dishes.  We shared a variety of sides including asparagus (steamed and sauteed), lobster mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, and king crab gnocchi (which was out of this world!!!!!)     Bottom line, it's definitely worth a visit.  We will be going back next time we are in Vegas.

      Truly enjoyed all aspects of dining here. The dungeness crab was excellent, and our steaks were cooked perfectly. I could probably do without the 400 degree plate. It's Vegas, I really didn't need anything to make the evening warmer. The service was attentive, and the wine selection was nice.  I will definitely stop in at the new location Chicago to sample more of their appetizers and fish selections.

      Excellent   Came here with a party of 30 so I got to sample everything. We reserved their private dining room and it was fantastic. Service was great, the room was perfect because we could be as loud as we wanted, and the food stole the show.   Must have....... would be their seafood platter. It's a 3 tier platter that comes with dry ice giving that smoky, cloudy look. It came with oysters, shrimp, king crab legs, and lobster over a bed of shaved ice.   The bone in rib eye, bone in Kansas city, and bone in fillet were all perfectly cooked and seasoned. Do not get the fish here. The sea bass was a little overcooked and dry. Then again, why the hell would you order fish at a steakhouse?   Lobster mashed potatoes was great but not when this cost more than the entrees. I was told that this dish was featured in Entourage and a few other magazines.   We celebrated 8 birthdays so the staff gave us 8 individual desserts which was very nice of them. Their butter cake was to die for. My God that was good. Their bread pudding and apple crisp were also very delicious.

      I have been to the Mastro's in Los Angeles and when I saw the Ocean Club at the City Center in Las Vegas - I have to say I was a bit taken a back. Do not get me wrong reader - here is this amazing bird's nest modern structure that looks like it should be in a museum somewhere....nested in a MALL. Given the shops were all upscale. But still, a MALL to say the least. It had that new mall smell that you'll just never get out of your clothes. It left me wondering what the restaurant and atmosphere would be like during dinner service. Well, I didn't have to wonder. My group had planned a bachelorette dinner for the lucky bride to be.   Staff - These people are pros. Seriously, every person works together like a well oiled machine. We had a group of nine girls, which is not easy but I'm sure they see that pretty often. It is Vegas. And the service was fantastic. Our waiter and the whole wait staff was really great and accommodating. Our reservations were at 745pm and we had to be out of there by 915pm to catch our ride. They were so mindful of that the whole time, but also didn't take away from the experience.   The meal - What can I say about the food that has not already been said? Pretty much nothing - so I'll just reinforce what my fellow yelpers have been saying the whole time - it's amazing. I ordered the salmon and one of the other girls ordered a fillet and we shared both plates. Both cooked perfectly. For sides - Lobster mashed potatoes, regular mashed potatoes and asparagus. All delicious.   The whole experience was wonderful. And I had serious reservations about what this was going to entail when I walked in. But Mastro's did not disappoint. I enjoyed stepping back and being able to compare my experience in LA to Vegas. And although each restaurant had their similarities whether it be with the menu or just how the staff serves you, both restaurants still had a their own uniqueness which made each experience stand out.

      Came here a couple weeks ago with my girlfriend and had absolutely the best seafood I have had in a long time.  We started off with a couple cosmos which are my favorite at the Ocean Club because they seem to be never ending and they use dry ice to keep it exceptionally cold!  For our entree we chose the seafood tower (see pic) which was amazing and a ton of food!  After that we could not eat anything more except desert and our waitress Shauna told us the Butter Cake could not be beat and she was right.  I would definitely recommend  Mastro's Ocean Club for a fine dining experience... the service is spectacular, the food is spectacular and the restaurant is very cool.

      Was there while in Las Vegas for business. My hosts were contractors on the project and we maybe got a little extra pampering. There were 7 of us.   Food is incredible. We didn't order appetizers, but a couple of us did have salads. The entrees around the table were steaks, swordfish, and seared tuna. We shared the stellar mashed potatoes, along with creamed corn and broccoli. For desert, they just left us the desert tray. We couldn't finish it!   Service is second to none. Everything you would expect.

      WOW I was pretty impressed with this place and I've done my share of dining in Vegas. The decor was modern and in the middle had this treehouse area where there are more tables. That night, they happened to have the treehouse rented out so there was live music playing which got a bit annoying since it was loud. That was my main complaint.   On to the food. We started with the seafood tower and I wasn't even hungry going into this dinner but I gobbled everything up. It had jumbo shrimp cocktail, kunumoto oysters, crab claws, lobster, and king crab legs, the works. It was presented with dry ice. They served it with cocktail sauce, this mustard sauce and atomic horseradish, when you mix all 3 it was a pretty good sauce that way too.   I was pretty full so I opted to get a salad and I chose the iceberg salad. Now I have to say i always get dressings on the side but this dressing was a red wine vinaigrette but it was creamy looking. The waitress said it was emulsified but there was no cream in it. It was the BEST salad dressing I have ever had! I think i wanted to dip every lettuce in a spoonful of dressing, that's how much I liked it.  It just had this tangy taste (from the red wine) but a smooth creamy texture but it had no creme. YUM!  I tried my bf's steak and he had the rib eye and it was delicious, melt in your mouth meat. Our favorite steak houses in Vegas are Michael's (Southpoint) and Cut (Palazzo) but I think Mastro's takes the cake on this. We had so many sides, potato's au gratin, snow peas, yam fries, mac and cheese but I heard the gnocci here was delicious from the rest of our party although I was too stuffed to try.   But the best part of dinner was the dessert! We had the warm butter cake, it tasted like a mix of pound cake and maybe cheesecake but it is served with vanilla ice cream and had a creamy inside, and sugar flakes line the cake to give it texture. Oh and it comes with homemade whip cream! I think that was better than the ice cream, I wanted to eat gobs of it.   This is definitely a favorite now although the seafood tower is VERY pricey, it was probably half of the price of the meal, and we were with a party of 10. n

      I'm not sure if it was me expecting too much because all my other mastro's experiences in california were Uh-Ma-Zing, but this experience at Mastro's in Las Vegas was very much so a disappointment.  I'm with Brad T, only 3 stars.... =(  1.  Kunomoto oysters were ordered off menu and pretty fresh and tasty, but I've had better. 2.  By the time we finished our oysters, which was only a few minutes because we eat fast, we started our COLD crab cakes.  I don't know about other people's experiences, but we've always had our crab cakes kind of toasty.  Though it was crab-a-licious, I was put off by the temperature. 3.  Our 22 oz bone-in ribeye was cooked rare plus and it was delicious!  The extra sear with clarified butter is fantastic.  However, I was not pleased with the amount of connective tissue in my half of the steak.  I felt like I was prepping my own meal by having to cut through all that chewy stuff! 4.  Here's the moment of utmost disappointment.  I was thinking about my fluffy, warm and tasty butter cake all night long, and it was a butter cake fail.  It was not warm and fluffy as I remember.  It was actually almost grainy and almost cold on the outside, save the inside was warm but almost soggy.  The wonderful airy whipped cream was actually heavy and too sweet.  Conclusion:  For being open for 6 months, should I expect it to be where its other Mastro counterparts are in amazing-ness, or should I expect it to be working out its kinks and be amazing 6 more months down the line?  Regardless of kinks or not, I'm a sad puppy because other than the yummy steak mixed with connective tissue bits, everything else was just average compared to my other Mastro's experiences.  Mastro's did not rise to the occasion to it's reputation.  Will I go back?  For the love of butter cake, I will after more time has passed for this particular establishment.  [side note: If you do try this particular Mastro's, do asked to be sit in the nice atrium with the mollusk looking wooden structure and not right outside of it.  I think you will get better service.  It seems as if the table we were sitting at is a "blind spot".  The servers liked to walk over an peer over the railing next to you and chat about the stores and patrons below as if you weren't there.]

      The hottie and I headed to Mastro's Ocean Club on a weekend trip to Vegas.  A friend of mine has been pumping up Mastro's to me for years.  I ordered the bone in rib eye.... my favorite!  I would say that its not as good as Del Frisco's but still very good.  The hottie got the sea bass which was excellent.  We started off with fried calamari which was nothing special.  For sides we got creamed spinach which was pretty good and gorgonzola mac n cheese which was not good.  I'm not a big fan of gorgonzola from the start so it wasn't a surprise that I did not like it that much.  But the hottie is a big fan of gorgonzola and even she said it wasn't good.  We loved the tree house look and its a first class place.  We even saw Pete Rose there with a...... ahem companion.  Overall thumbs up!

      I've dined at many a Mastro's, and I must admit: this location hooked me (and my rumbling stomach) + a pal for lunch because I found it architecturally intriguing.   The staff in the front of the house were still very wet behind the ears. I was asked, "Is there any special occasion that you're celebrating? Anniversary, birthday...?"   I replied that I am a living kidney donor and I celebrate that every day. My response didn't even register with the hostess and there wasn't any acknowledgment at all. *shrug* People have birthdays every year; it's not that often you have the privilege of donating a kidney. Just saying.   I'm a sucker for waitstaff in white jackets; there's something very genteel about it that I absolutely adore, though the ambiance was a bit odd - the skylights above took away some of the mystery and glamour that one might otherwise enjoy over dinner. All the better to admire the lines and the strange view that our perch afforded us.   Couldn't help but wonder: because the "pod" is not enclosed by walls, but mesmerizing woodwork that undulates and is breathtakingly organic... do shoppers at the nearby boutiques get distracted by the smells of the kitchen?   "Yes, I'd like this limited edition Dior - hold up a minute - I need me a steak! " Surf, turf and couture - pinch me, please, and pass the pretzel bread, I'm wearing a silk shift with an empire waist - Carbonanza!!!   The pretzel bread is otherworldly. I ignored the other varieties in the very generous bread basket, and asked for more pretzel bread, which was delivered warm, fluffy and perfectly salted. A healthy slathering of room-temperature butter didn't hurt, either. Even though I don't eat wheat, I was no match for the PB, and just surrendered to each bite of pillowy bliss.   My virgin strawberry martini was not as tasty as the high octane version (yes, I had a sippie and was glad I did) and was just too sweet for my palate - but I had to wash all that PRETZEL BREAD down with something, right?   Another quirk: there was a phantom lounge singer, who was, to be honest, not good at all... it was almost comical. It took me a while to figure out that it wasn't tongue-in-cheek lounge-lizardy - the dude was actually that schmaltzy. He was playing and singing live... but from an indeterminate location - I think it was behind the blue curtain - but it was just so odd, we kept laughing about it.   My crab cocktail was okay... it was fresh and bright, but the last 1/3rd was frozen, because of the ice bath in which it sat. To their credit, when I pointed that out, a fresh one was brought out.   The salads were nice. Nothing that knocked my Paul Smith espadrilles off, but I was very pleased that the greens were not drowning in dressing. Nice, simple, tasty.   I plan to go again, but will make a reservation for dinner; lighting makes a difference, but then again... Pretzel Bread tastes good at any hour!   BELIEVE.
