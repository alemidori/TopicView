      Between Serendipity 3 and this place Caesar's has the Vegas market cornered when it comes to over-priced desserts and junk food. But, despite it being a tourist trap I wanted to check it out. Afterall, it's a tourist trap filled with lots of chocolatey goodness.  I stopped by with my son for lunch and they tried to seat us at a tiny 2-top right by the entrance, outside of the actual restaurant. um... no, not a good choice. I asked to be seated somewhere else. They brought us inside and sat us at another small 2-top. I'm not one to bitch and moan, so we took it. It seems like most of the tables on the lower level are small (They have a second floor that I didn't check out). When you combine that with the large plates that everything is served on, it makes for a crowded and uncomfortable dining experience.  The menus are kind of ridiculous, both in a good and bad way. There's a spiral bound book that lists all the sweets. There's a separate menu for brunch, lunch and dinner with no entrees for less than $12. Even their sandwiches are $13+. Even for Las Vegas standards, I think that's outrageously pricey. Kids get their own menu with a pack of crayons.  We ordered: - Blackened skirt steak &amp; mushroom quesadilla ($14.95) - filled with tender strips of steak, sauteed mushrooms, topped with salsa and sour cream and laying on a bed of thin tortilla strips. Mighty tasty, but I couldn't stop thinking that I was paying for a $14 quesadilla.  - Kid's order of chicken fingers ($8.25) - 3 chick fingers with waffle fries. My kid loved them and the waffle fries were some of the best I've had. The meal comes with a paint brush. A couple of the waiters encouraged my kid to paint with the mustard and ketchup provided. Obviously, they don't have kids. If I let my kid do that he would have painted himself, me, the table and any poor soul passing by. It's cool that they encourage that because it makes for a fun, kid-friendly environment, but it may not be the best thing for a two year old to do.  We also ordered a lemonade ($3.50) which was kind of like a slushy and got a dark chocolate hazelnut shake ($7.95) to go. The shake was rich, creamy and delicious.  We were too full to experience their desserts (except for the shake), but I'd gladly come back to try one or two.  The service was excellent. We had a main server who was very attentive and eager to explain the concept of the restaurant and answer any questions. There were also a few other waiters who stopped by to see if we needed anything. Even the hostesses were very friendly. They gave my kid a couple temporary tattoos to put on later as we left.  Yeah, I would go back but probably just for dessert. I still can't believe I spent $44 (including the tip) for lunch for one adult and a two year old. I'm used to spending a lot for food but this was a little excessive.  3.5 Stars

      They didn't get 5 stars because most of the dinner food was bad. Pizzas were just okay, thai chicken satays were cold and flavorless. The Mac and Cheese was AMAZING, ask for some chopped jalapenos to go with it. Comes with chopped tomatoes and tomato sauce on the side.   Desserts are to die for, 5+ stars. They have special plates for each menu item. I love the hot chocolate, stay (not to go) and you'll be served in a great palm-able mug. My favorite is the waffles, the ice cream sundays are also amazing, with all the topping served separate for you to mix.

      Walking through the Forum shops, outside a place called Max Brenner, my group of 7 (from adults to children) were offered sweets to taste and being chocolate experts, we decided to stay for dinner!  The Mac &amp; Cheese was amazing.  THe tacos were fantastic and the burger was thick and juicy.  kids had P-nut Butter and Banana sanwiches with chocolate to dip them in and they were in heaven.  We rushed through to get to the deserts.  Smores Sunday....WOW!  Ice Cream bars from Israel with toppings to dip in - What fun and delicious.  Chocolate Pizza - how can you go wrong!  Service was outstanding and very attentive.  Finished the meal with a stop in the candy shop for treats to take home.

      Make no mistake, Max Brenner serves food, but it is only so you won't feel guilty about eating their chocolate desserts.  Hence they have a reminder on their menu - Food first then dessert.  Any place that gives you syringes filled with warm chocolate ganache to squirt in your mouth is a place worth visiting.    The regular food menu did not have anything that really enticed my tastebuds - sandwiches, burgers, etc.  So we ordered some appetizers that sounded good.  Mac n cheese with marinara on the side - don't ask, that is a new one for me.  It was very cheesy, a bit salty, some bacon added, but nothing that great.  The waffle fries which are supposedly dusted with chili cocoa powder were run-of-the-mill.  I could not taste the difference with regular waffle fries and the dipping sauce they came with overwhelmed the dish with saltiness.  The hummus sampler was ok, a bit too bland, but the pita chips had a great crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  The black and tan beer battered onion rings are worth a special mention.  Most beer battered onion rings I have had at other places are overfried and bland.  When you take a bit into these, you get a wonderful hoppy, malty flavor and aroma from the beer.  A bit of a surprise if you are not expecting it, but a depth of dimension you cannot find elsewhere.  Now getting to the desserts.  The sharing tasting menu is a good starting point for those who can't decide.  It states on the menu that it is good for two but you can actually have 4 people share.  There is just wayyy too much chocolatey goodness for just 2 people.  It is comprised of : chocolate banana waffles chocolate crispy eggroll milk and white chocolate bar chocolate sponge cake crunchy little chocolate pearls chocolate fondue with grill and fruits and marshmallows and chocolate ganache to drizzle over everything.  The chocolate fondue is very fun as you can toast your marshmallows then dip into the melted chocolate.  After sharing this plate, I got a shock of chocolate euphoria which resulted from the the endorphin rush.  An absolute must have is the suckao.  Although the name makes it sound like a porno term, it is a combination of suck and cacao.  It is like the hot chocolate drinks that you can find in Europe.  You basically get a little container of milk (I recommend whole) which is kept heated over a little tea candle.  Then you also have a choice of what chocolate you want - dark, milk, or white (dark recommended).  From here you add the chocolate to the milk to your liking stirring with a spoon that doubles as a straw.  As the chocolate melts and combines with the milk, you get a rich chocolate beverage, essentially chocolate ecstasy.  You are technically making your own miniature ganache and drinking it.  Few things in life can produce such joy.  If you are not use to such huge amounts of chocolate, take caution as it will literally give you a high.  Best Thing - Hot chocolate

      Went here on a whim on opening day @ the Forum Shops on 8/5 coincidentally for my husband's b-day. At first, we had plans to go elsewhere, but after tasting the samples, we gave it a go for dinner.  The restaurant itself is really cool and reminds me of Willy Wonka's Chocolate factory with brown decor everywhere, and pools of chocolate mixing in the front and a tiny shop to the side. Just so happens that Mr. Brenner was heavily influenced from watching the movie to become a chocolatier, but that's beside the point.  We were seated in front and got to watch samples be given and shot into customer's throats, literally. It was funny. They have these chocolate syringes that cost about $5 and other little goodies such as cookie shakes and those lovely pralines to die for that they sell in front to reel 'em in. It worked.  Well, as for dinner food, I ordered the Asparagus Crepe and my DH, the Sesame-crusted Salmon, my 2-yr. old got the Crunchy Mac &amp; Cheese w/ marinara in a syringe w/ a side of cheese (?). His was fairly decent, not out of this world. Mine plain sucked. I only ate half as it was pretty tasteless and barely had any asparagus w/ mainly cheese and spinach which made it all soggy. I however, adored my child's dish (which she barely ate and instead took my waffle fries) It was one of the best Mac&amp;Cheese dishes I've ever had in a restaurant, crunchy on top, gooey inside, and just that right amount of sharp taste i like w/ the asiago cheese. The marinara complemented the dish well.   Now, desserts are what had me give the 4 stars, (minus the one for the meals themselves). We ordered the combo w/ the Lava Cake, Chocolate shot, and ice cream w/ a side of chocolate sauce. For his b-day, they gave this measly piece of chocolate w/ a little tealight. (I was cool w/ that considering they had just opened and were very nice to us). The cake was awesome along w/ the ice cream which helped out the heaviness of the cake. The shot was very good but for me, that chocolate sauce killed it for me. I could have drank that whole cup alone despite it being a "sauce". It was like a melted milk chocolate bar! I swear.   So overall, we were pretty satisfied w/ our experience as customer service went over and beyond to treat us well being it's first day. We asked the server if Mr. Brenner was there, and as we were walking out they whispered "He's over there in the striped shirt in the back."  We saw the bald headed man and wished we had sat longer as he was greeting guests when we left. Hopefully they can work on the regular food, but of course the desserts will remain the star of the show. I would totally not mind if it was solely a chocolate dessert shop as I have a feeling the restaurant part may not go well. That's just a prediction since it just opened.   Recommendations:  -DESSERT-that's what we'll go back for to try from the multitude of selections they had.  -The Chocolate Shop-too tiny but so cool. Pricey but worth it. TRY the Chockies and the different Pralines. Our favorite was the Pecan and Almond. The Hazelnut was so-so.  For all you Chocolholics, it will be quite an experience.

      If I said I love chocolate, that would be incorrect. My affinity, infatuation, and appreciation for chocolate cannot be properly described with the simple word "love."   Let me put it this way, if teeth deterioration and diabetes did not exist, I'd have chocolate for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Point is, I really can't get enough.   Anyway, Max Brenner had me at "Do you want a chocolate shot?" (mind you, the woman was holding a large plastic syringe filled will delicious, warm chocolate). To Pedro P.'s dismay and slight disgust, I enthusiastically agreed to have a communal plastic syringe stuck in my mouth to try some of Max Brenner's chocolate. YUM. (I also tried a chocolate covered praline and Italian hot chocolate). And when we went to the Forum Shops in Caesar's Palace the next day, I opted for another chocolate shot before we went in for lunch.   Sure, the food we ordered was good. I had a mozzarella and basil pizza, but the star of the show was my adult beverage. I had a "chocolate aphrodisiac" called Satisfaction Guaranteed -- and yes, I was quite satisfied.   The drink has peanut and caramel liqueur and.... wait for it, wait for it.... milk chocolateeeeeee. It really was delicious. I just wish that it came in a jumbo size.

      I came by today to get a few photos to post on Yelp.  A voice sounding much like Misti's said, "Well you've come this far.  You might as well have something so you can review the place, too!"   I know, it's a heck of a job, but someone's got to do it.  I forced myself to enter the restaurant, perused the menu for quite awhile, and then decided to try the Hazelnut Cream Chocolate Milkshake made with vanilla bourbon ice cream, dark chocolate truffle, and topped with whipped cream.  It was served in an "Alice" mug that says, "Drink Me," a signature mug of the bald man.  It comes from a statement in Alice in Wonderland when she found a little bottle with a paper label that said, "Drink me."  The milkshake was outstanding if a bit pricey - $7.95.  The restaurant is quite nice, and the employees were just excellent - smiles all around and very helpful.  I also bought a tin of caramelized pecans rolled in praline cream and cocoa powder for later nourishment.  Take one as needed.  I want to come back when I have a late lunch/early dinner and try some of the food offerings.  It's quite a nice place.

      Uhmmm. If this isn't Charlie's Chocolate Factory then, I don't know what is.  Friends and I were walking through Forum Shops just when they opened and they were offering "chocolate injections!"  That could be 1) porn OR 2) ridiculously warm chocolatey goodness.  Shockingly: it was the latter! But, boy did it satisfy the need for sweets that I didn't have; til then. It was warm chocolate ganash in a giant syringe. Warm, smooth, semi-sweet chocolate injected straight into your mouth. GENIUS!  I had to buy one; and my friend bought two. The good thing about it was you could "inject" yourself anytime you want and as much as you want because the syringe of chocolate could be stored in the fridge.   "Inject" yourself with a shot of chocolate!!!   Can't wait to eat there because they have more than just chocolate. Can you imagine the dessert???!

      The worker lured me in with an awesome sample of that chocolate pizza and a very warm hello.     First of all, the PRESENTATION of the food...beautiful! It was unique and just very pretty and impressive, I almost didn't want to eat it.  The pictures really don't do it any justice.  The plate comes with little dishes filled with sauces, like chocolate or other sweet sauces/butterscoth? on the side.  I like this because you can add sweetness to taste.  The bananas that came with my crepe were also served individually.  I saw other people's dishes, like their burgers, the presentations are appetizing, I wanted to taste everything on the menu.      Had the hot chocolate with a shot of Bailey's: ....mmmm...it was a tad sweet, I believe b/c of the Bailey's, but was good.      The next day I was craving it and came back for some more.  This time, I ordered the choclate crepe with hazelnut, toffee and banana...woah was it awesome! The icecream had a nice little bunch of crispy nuts covered in this spicy curry-ish? sort of spice on it, it  totally caught me off guard, it was like wait,what was that? huh? awesome!  The crepe had all kinds of textures to it, soft, crispy, fluffy at the same time.  High quality chocolate.      I also tried their chocolate oatmeal, delicious, the best oatmeal I've ever tasted.         Their coffee was really good, kind of tasted a little bit like Mexican Cafe de Olla.         The portions are large, their dishes are meant to be shared. I think you could share a crepe among 3 people with normal appetites.  The oatmeal you can probably share among 2.  The dishes are simply too rich to have large portions, you'll definately feel fatter after eating this, but well worth it.         I think that their awesome customer service is worth mentioning, both times I went there all of the workers were super helpful and nice, I really appreciated the unpretentiousness.  The only problem was that the girls in the merchandise area weren't very knowledgable about prices for merchendise, and prices weren't on all of the merchendise    I bought some mugs to bring home as souveniers, even though I don't think that the cute "hug mugs" serve their purpose so well - if you try to "hug" it, it will burn the F*@** outta your hands, so let your chocolate cool before you hug it.                  The place is very clean, nostalgic, and romantic.  Reminds me a little bit of disneyland.  Would definately come back. Great place for a date first date.       Just to compare, I also visited the famous Jean Phillipe pastry place at the Bellagio, hands down M. Brenner is better.  J.P left me a little dissapointed with their very eggy-tasting desserts.  They weren't awful, but definately not the quality I expected from J.P.  M. Brenner has better desserts.

      The Skinny: the desserts are okay but (3) the service is terrible for a weekend brunch in a restaurant that isn't even full - what's a gal gotta to do to get some water around here? there's an excessive heat wave outside, people!!!(1) value: the dessert tasting is okay but so not worth the aggrevation (1).  We arrived at Max Brenner for a relaxing Saturday brunch. Turns out our experience was anything but relaxing.   Initially, we were seated promptly by the hostess and waited. And waited. And waited. We sat there with our menus with no one taking a drink order. Our waitress shows up and tells us that she'll be right with us. Afterwards she just disappeared on us again. Another long interlude passes.  At this point, I was thinking about chewing on a napkin and wondering if I should just get some water upstairs from the sink in the bathroom.   Finally she shows up and takes our orders. Water takes forever to come and so does our orders. We stayed at the restaurant for 2 hours... for them to make a plate of eggs, a burger with fries, a waffle and a fried chocolate egg roll. Plus, there's an excessive heat warning outside and they take forever to refill your water glasses (which are surprising tiny - their hug mugs hold about as much liquid). I think in the two hour time span, they got refilled once. May I remind you, this is while you are eating some incredibly rich food.  The real food itself is okay (ie, the burger and the omelette). Nothing earth shattering.  The dessert tasting is both overwhelming in richness, underwhelming in quality.  I think in the end, the dessert tasting really lacked a good editing eye.  Tasting includes: a belgian waffle with syrup, caramelized banana, nuts with choice of ice cream and chocolate ganache; fried chocolate eggroll with Mexican spices ?bananas and peanuts; two different chocolate "bark"; a bowl of chocolate krispies; a fondue set with strawberries, bananas, and marshmallows (and hibachi for roasting).  The belgian waffle is too overloaded with stuff. First, you have the syrup, nuts and caramelized bananas. Then you drown it in ice cream and chocolate ganache? The waffle at this point is totally lost in the whole process - becoming soggy from all the ingredients. It's just too much.  The fried eggroll was filled with a chile pepper spiced chocolate with banana and peanuts inside. Albeit it was different and interesting, the eggroll became soggy from the chocolate inside.  My husband and I found the two chocolate bars and chocolate covered rice krispies (supposedly malt balls but I didn't taste any malt flavouring) to be too sweet in combination with everything else. The brownies were okay, not great.   The fondue (dark chocolate, baby!) was alright. We were wondering about the fire hazard we were going to create because flame kept setting our marshmallows on fire.  Honestly, the dessert tasting is okay - would probably share it with 3-4 instead of 2 because it is really too much for two to handle. However, factor in all the other things like crappy service I have to say a 2 star review.

      If you love chocolate, you won't be disappointed.    Ordered a fondue sampler which was great!!! Service was good, prices were ok, but the food was awesome!  The only reason they get 5 stars is because service was kinda slow, and our waitress, although nice, seemed like a hott mess.

      My mouth is still watering!  I'm a big fan of all à la mode desserts.  We shared the Banana Split Waffle. Topped with Vanilla Bourbon Ice cream, Milk chocolate truffle and caramelized rice krispies.  Enjoyed with a Satisfaction Guaranteed cocktail.    *Service was great served with a smile. *From the style/decor you get the feeling that dessert's are their specialty and not food. Don't go to this place and order salad or pasta you will be disappointed.

      Wow.   That pretty much sums it up for me.  I'm a fan of this restaurant/cafe and hope to come back for more.  Not only is the ambiance fun, but the food choices are excellent and the whole place explodes of chocolate.  From chocolate cocktails to cocoa dusted waffle fries, Max Brenner covers everything with a bit of sweet satisfaction.  For the Forums this place is reasonably priced and all dishes can easily be shared by two people if you have a small appetite.  I truly enjoyed the eating their appetizer of fried pita with bobba..something..and their spice rubbed wings were awesome.  I had the classic burger with waffle fries--huge, juicy, and yummy--and my husband had the fish sandwhich, which consisisted of fried salmon and not fried white fish.  It was a great twist and was interesting to eat (although I don't like salmon at all).  We had a hazelnut cream shake that came in a cool glass (I bought one on my way out), and their vanilla popsicle fondue for dessert was fun and just the right size.  If you're looking for a chocolate experience that's fresh in town, try out Max Brenner.  It's a great place for chocolate, food, and overall fun.  PS: Ask for Danielle.  She's a star!

      I had my first Max Brenner experience two weeks ago and I can't wait for another opportunity to try it out again.  Stopped in here on a whim after being lured in by chocolate samples.  What really grabbed our attention was the restaurant's mood.  After a long day shopping on the strip this place seemed like the ideal place to relax and get a dose of chocolate infused caffeine before heading out for the night.  I had the dark chocolate mocha served in the hug mug and was really surprised how much I enjoyed using this interesting take on a mug.  The service here was really good.  They were able to find a table for the 4 of us at the last minute next to the bar despite it being incredibly booked.  I wish we had one of these in LA.

      I must echo all who came before me! The sandwiches looked fabulous although I did not go there for the regular food. We went for the Chocolate. We had the fondue and split it between 3 and was satisfied. I can't wait to return or better yet..... have one open here in DC!!! I asked the GM if we'd ever see one.... no commitment but their other two restaurants are doing very well.

      This place is ammaazzzzinnngggg!! I found out about Max Brenner initially from when I want to NYC.  I like the NYC location better because it was more spacious, but Vegas definitely has its own unique ambiance that suited the restaurant.  So let's get down to the food:  White Hot Chocolate- My favorite drink! I got this in NYC as well.  I added an amaretto shot just because it's Vegas and it was delish.   Mexican Hot Chocolate- Also a great choice--creamy hot chocolate with a bit of a spicy kick to it.  Chai Tea- Came in a self-press kettle for extra freshness. Was amazing as well, but I would personally go for a chocolate drink  Chocolate Pizza- I know this is what they're known for, but I definitely DID NOT like it :(...  It was waaay too rich and tasted like I was eating 3 bars of melted chocolate at once.  Definitely a must for the experience, but never again.  Sugar Banana Waffle- This is the second waffle I've tried here and I don't think you can really go wrong with any of their waffles. My favorite part is the small Erlenmeyer-like flask of chocolate that comes with it.  Brenner Burger- Your typically restaurant burger.  Good for a burger, but not anything too special.  The waffle fries dusted in cocoa powder and the sauce it came with were my favorite parts.  Things I love about Max Brenner other than the food: the service, the hug mugs, the alice cup, the restaurant's design (100% pure chocolate pipes everywhere, the "you look good today" mirror in the bathroom, the menu, etc)

      So, let me start by saying that we just grabbed a slice of the Chocolate Pizza to go. Not much, but we wanted a dessert and figured that a place based entirely around chocolate would be a good choice.   To continue, the chocolate on the chocolate pizza may be the best chocolate I have ever had. The chocolate pizza has a sweet pizza dough covered with liquid milk and white chocolate. To be honest, I felt like the dough actually took a little bit away from the fantastic chocolate, mostly because the pizza dough isn't very soft. However, the chocolate was so good that it didn't matter. I would like to see a version of the pizza with a traditional, crunchy, thin crust. I can't wait to go back and try the other food, especially a Double Dark Chocolate Cookie. If you just want a sweet chocolatey dessert, I would recommend the Chocolate Syringe, which is a giant syringe filled with warm chocolate that you just squirt into your mouth. At $5.00, its a very reasonable, delicious dessert for the Vegas strip.  As for the service, the person helping us at the little stand outside was extremely friendly. They were able to answer all of our questions and seemed very knowledgable about all the items offered.   In conclusion, I will be back here when I'm back on the strip and it is definitely going on my list of favorites! I highly recommend this place to anyone in the area.

      max brenners, what can i say?  absolutely amazing and chocolate heaven! if you love sweets and chocolate this is the place for you. my friends and i came here for breakfast on saturday. the staff is friendly and knowledgeable about all their drinks and food. we all had omelettes and one person had their banana waffles. the portions dont look that huge, but once you start eating you are stuffed. i had the well behaved omelette absolutely delicious. and its interesting that they inculde a biscuit with the meal to dip in the chocolate sauce. its a nice sweet and savory combination.   also loved the hot chocolate in the hug mug its adorable. also had the white chocolate strawberry smoothie, i have to say i tasted everything the ice cream, the white chocolate and strawberries were all combined nicely. i loved the cup it came in, it said drink me and its from alice in wonderland!

      I wish i saved the pictures on my phone to share this experience with you all.   Located inside Cesar's Palace, near Spago and Guess.  Faves and I were both intrigued by this place due to the name of the restaurant and the similarity of it.  Max "chocolate by the bald guy"..just took off the last name.  Pretty crazy.    We came in close to 7 or 8pm and there werent many people in there and I dont know why.  This is such a good place!  We ordered the smoke rub chicken wings, bacon-cheddar-chicken rolls and mac &amp; cheese. I would tell you how they were individually but I would max out the 5k character limit on my review.  Definetely have to try them out, really good quality food!    Drinks: I ordered the satisfaction guaranteed aphrodisiac chocolate drink which was spectacular and faves order a berry something chocolate drink which was also great as well.  For dessert, we settled for the fried bananas and asked for both the dark and milk chocolate dippings sauces which also came with a toffee dipping sauce as well.  So damn good!!  I wish they had something like this in frisko.  This would be one of those things that i can wait in line for.  Many props to our waiter Ismael who took care of my friend and I.  Very kind man, who knows the menu (food and drinks) very well!

      I NEED to come back here. I don't think I got my chocolate fix!   This place is a must go.. at least once! The plating and presentation is creative, unique, and "cute"   We did appetizers.. and all had bacon in them. Bacon is not my fave, but I was just going along with it. We had the "best macaroni and cheese," chicken skewers, and another got a BLAT: bacon, lettuce, avocado, tomato.   I don't think this was the best macaroni and cheese, or whichever that was called. Yes, it was good, yes it was cheesy, gooey, creamy... but maybe I am biased because of the bacon that was spread throughout.   Chicken skewers were tasty. Placed on toothpicks and wrapped in bacon, with a dipping sauce that I didn't focus on enough to distinguish.   As for the dessert, which i will be back for next time... Screw the food!!  I think the milkshakes are incredible and have a little Alice in Wonderland story to go along with them.. I have never had a milk shake like that before, this is a must get!   We also shared a fondue with dark chocolate, caramel, and milk chocolate. The fondues came with brownies, choc chip cookies, marshmallows, strawberries, and bananas. Also, a little grill for roastin and toastin!   This is a fun place to come as a group. I also noticed a side bar for to-go orders. So, if you want to enjoy while walking through the shops, or the strip... grab a milkshake to-go!

      Our server Danielle (I hope I got that right) made some awesome suggestions I was tipsy off chocolate and munching on a fried fish sandwich.  The chicken wing appetizer was also awesome.  Cool atmosphere, music and friendly staff.  This place will definitely see me again.  I will be the guy trying ro eat some the decorations.

      A friend and I stopped here for a quick chocolate experience.  We tried the Mexican Spicy Hot Chocolate drink in their "Hug Mug".  It had red chili, nutmeg, cinnamon and pepper in it.  I know the chili and pepper sound a little weird in a chocolate drink, and it does tingle, but it's a fascinating sensation, and really pleasant.  I was admittedly disappointed by the decor.  They have these pipes labeled "Chocolate" that run through the bar and look like they are depositing chocolate from some untapped source a la Willy Wonka to their chocolate dispensers.  After inquiring, the waitress admitted they don't really tap chocolate from an underground well.  Consider my dreams shattered.  I give it 4 stars based on only having one drink thus far and no further frame of reference, but I could see this being a good date place.  The service was nice, the decor is pleasant (even if it lies), and our server was friendly.  Not bad for an impromptu treat.

      Best chocolate shake i've ever tasted! totally surpasses Serendipity and better than Godiva in my opinion.  I ordered the first shake off of the frozen/ chocolate shake section ($8).  Served in their quintessential milk shake mug ($13)and floated a ball of bourbon vanilla ice cream on top with chocolate crust.  I couldn't help but purchased a couple of those mugs myself.    Didn't get into their desserts but sure will next time.  The banana and chocolate crunchy plate with waffles ($14)seemed good.  I tried a piece of chocolate covered pecans ($11 for 2.8oz )and it was very good as well.  Ordered a chicken and soba salad($13), and a beef quesadilla ($14)to go and they were good. Of course their chocolate goods are better though.  Will definitely go back!

      Located inside Cesear's Palace, my husband and I came here for dinner while visiting.  The food was delicious.  We started with a dark chocolate drink served in the HugMug.  It was very good without being overly sweet.  For dinner he ordered the Brenner burger, and I had the vegetarian burger.  That was, without a doubt, the best veggie burger I've ever had.  He really liked his as well. The service was nice and efficient.  For desert we ordered the waffles, chocolate, and banana dish.  Absolutely worth getting.  We almost had to lick the plate clean it was so tasty.  I highly recommend this restaurant for outstanding food and a fabulous experience with chocolate.

      I fell in love with Max Brenner and I haven't even met him yet!   So we were walking around Forum on Sunday because I was killing time before my flight back to SD.  I saw a huge sign that says "Chocolate Love Story" and curious me went to find out what the heck it was.  At the hostess counter, I saw "chocolate pizza" and immediately walked in.  Everything about this place screams chocolate, and is enough to make anyone fall in love!  FOOD: I ordered the Spicy Chicken Pizza and the Brenner Burger. It came with spicy chipotle mayonnaise and an onion ring inside.  The pizza was on thin crust and was enough to feed 4 people.  It was really good, because we took the suggestion from the hostess that seated us.  The burger was very juicy and the patty was really thick.  The bread was fresh and complimented the burger very well!  It came with waffle fries, which were really crispy and delicious!  SERVICE: Our waiter was awesome.  They have great service here (which made up for the lack of good customer service we had the night before).  I didn't get his name but almost everyone I spoke to there was very down to earth and willing to help.  After lunch, I went into the chocolate shop area, where they sell chocolates and shirts, so I could bring some of the chocolate lovin' home.  I ended up buying a chocolate cookbook ($25), a t-shirt ($14.50), a HugMug ($8.50), and an Alice cup ($13.50).  I had the help of some cute asian girl with awesome hair. She's very nice and even individually wrapped all my stuff for me to carry on the plane and the ones that I gave out as gifts.  AMBIANCE: I love the feel of this place. Its like its own chocolate factory!  The music was good, the people are friendly.  I would definitely come back. :)  Its as if I died and had gone to chocolate heaven.

      I had never heard of this place, but was planning a visit to LV and signed up for Groupons there to see if any good deals were available in the preceding weeks.  One was available for $24 worth of food for dine in only - the cost was $12.  After reading reviews, I was very excited to go, although the Groupon was restricted to 1 per table (there were going to be 4 of us in my party).  The Saturday I was in LV, the restaurant closed at 12.30am, and we got there at 12am.  Our server, Ryan, was nice, but I was trying to determine whether he was slightly annoyed that we came in so close to closing time.  After he gave us menus, then returned to see if we had any questions - it took asking so many questions to get some information out of him on what was good, etc.  At one point I felt bad asking so many questions - but if you're not forthcoming with information and we're overwhelmed - what do you expect?!  Anyhow, we finally settled on the Profiterole Fondue, an Apple Waffle and 2 Apple Crisps (pics coming soon).  After all the drama from perusing the menu and trying to decide, everyone in my party was spectacularly impressed!  The serving sizes were plenty for 1 person (could even be shared with 2), the flavors were decadent, and the chocolate was as perfect as I could imagine.  I had the fondue, and couldn't even finish it all because it was so rich.  Don't get grossed out, but it was so rich, I thought I might get sick at one point if I took another bite...and I still wanted to it was so good!  We were celebrating a birthday, so once we determined we could eat no more - Ryan brought out a tiny plate with a candle and a square of chocolate - a nice touch!  With the $24 Groupon, the bill came to a little over $50 - so it's a pricey place, but worth a once-in-a-while visit.  One bonus of being the last customers - another server asked us if we liked cookies.  Of course we said yes, and she she then brought each of us one of the large chocolate cookies that they were going to toss.  They were so thick, and they were warm!  We all decided to take them on the plane with us the next day, and I was so glad I did.  It was de-li-cious!  All in all, I was very happy I discovered this place.  I've been to a chocolate bar before in DC - but it can't compare....Max Brenner is simply the bomb.  Oh and the decor was so fun!  In the ladies room, the mirror had some writing on it that said something like "you look extremely good today"....how nice :)
