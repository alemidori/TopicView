      Thinking about fresh uni reminded me about the only all you can eat sushi place that I respect (never, ever mention Todai to me *puke*).  The only all you can eat aspect is the price.  Everything else is freshly made when you order.  They limit you to one of Amaebi, Uni or Toro but everything else is free for all.  This would be good sushi even without the all you can eat price tag but is the cream on top.

      Good deal on the all-you-can-eat where it's everything on the menu included, and make to order which is nice too.  Definitely a good deal if that's what you are looking for.  If you want really solid sushi then it's not the answer, although I suspect in LV that the solution would be really expensive.  c'est la vie.

      Yama's a good neighborhood place for sushi.  Like others have said, it's not the best bet for the best sushi, but if all you're looking for is to go out and chow down on an all-you-can-eat special and you're nearby, there's really no better choice.  It's definitely better than Sushi on Trop for both sushi and other dishes like bentos and the like.  Their salmon teriyaki here is great.    The service is always quick and friendly, and if you become a regular they treat you like one.  It's not in the best strip mall ever built, but it makes the quality a little bit of a surprise.  Recommended if you're in the area.

      It's not sushi from a 7-11 or Ralph's, but not quality like Hide or Nobu either, just your everyday run-of-the-mill strip mall sushi joint.  Stopped in here last Friday with a couple friends and had their AYCE deal, which for the price and selection is typical. We ordered four disappointing  orders of Hamachi among some appetizers and rolls. Avoid the fried chicken pieces appetizer - very fatty. The only thing that tasted exactly like I thought it would was the edamame and mochi - that's not saying much!

      I enjoyed this sushi place. When I was attending UNLV for my Master's, I came here for lunch with fellow classmates. It was never crowded at lunch time and early dinner time. The food was always very fresh, but the prices were elevated, considering that the food selection was anything but special.   The food selection was just run of the mill sushi place. Nothing too tradtional or too novel, yet it was good. I probably won't come here very often unless I am in UNLV area. There is nothing "special" about this sushi place, but it is better and fresher than many in the Vegas area.  Service is poor and prices are high, especially for being located almost right on a college campus. Servers and owners could use an attitude adjustment and lower their prices and then I would be a slightly more loyal customer.

      Even though this restaurant is in an unassuming strip mall, it really turned out to be a fun and delicious place to eat. Their sushi is fresh and tasty and the employees are friendly and helpful. I liked how the sushi chefs knew little English but were eager to help and get us whatever we needed.   They have an all-you-can-eat deal for $19.95. I don't know if it's for lunch only or dinner as well. My friend and I quickly hit the $20 mark without going with the all-you-can-eat deal. The chef noticed and asked if we wanted to switch over to the all-you-can-eat deal. Nice of him to do that.   I had a few pieces of sushi (salmon, smoked salmon and tuna roll) along with sushi salad. It's a salad with strips of tuna, salmon, octopus and yellowtail mixed in with some bits of spring lettuce mix and a spicy mayonnaisey sauce. At $6.95, it's a bit expensive but good.   They have a long sushi bar and a bunch of tables all around. Nobody seems to be in a hurry here so relax and enjoy yourself. I have only been here for lunch so I don't know how it is for dinner.  This place is worth the drive if you need a rest from the crazy strip.

      Worst service ever.  I grew up on sushi and the food in this place was just not good enough to visit again especially after the horrendous service.  I understand Korean fluently and I did not appreciate some of the things the employees were saying about the customers.

      I have always had great experiences here. The sushi is good and is cheap. Great place for lunch. I always sit at the sushi bar and receive great service. In response to the review saying the rolls and huge; 75% of the rolls are available in a half portion, that way you are able to try more.   Ask for the sexy salmon which is not on the menu. It is a piece of Salmon nigri with a piece of lemon, jalapeno, and special sauce.

      -- The sushi is good. 23 bucks for all u can eat anything off the menu is unbeatable. That means anything off their given menu..... sushi, appetizers, dessert..... everything.  -- I've gone there 3 times in the past 3 trips to vegas. Cousin brought me there to eat and make it point to go back everytime I'm in vegas.  -- Japanese cooks can mess up Japanese food. But this place doesnt.  -- Their special rolls are fun to try out. They usually have 20 special rolls of the night.   -- FYI, I was told alot of sushi restaurants in Vegas are moving toward to the all u can eat format. But this place has been doing it for years now.   -- Service was good.  KngKonga's take home advice: -- Order and try appetizers you wouldnt normally order. It's a good opportunity to try things if you havent tried different Japanese dishes.

      Great service, good menu, fair prices.  I've visited this one several times, and would gladly return.  It's a decent place comparable to other sushi joints I've been to around town.  They offer an all-you-can-eat option that follows the same rules as other places around town.  The floor space inside makes it one of the smaller establishments to which I've been a patron.

      I heart sushi. And I was craving it on my last trip to Vegas with the Pops.  He took me to Yama Sushi for the All You Can Eat deal and I told him I wasn't going to eat much..yeah that didn't happen. I'm pretty sure I had two rolls to myself (and you know it's alot of food considering the rolls are ginormous). I had eater's remorse from eating that much food..  Yama Sushi was muy bueno but my number one sushi place is on Olympic and Sawtelle called Daichan Kaiten Sushi..conveyor belt-style sushi. So yummy.

      when you think "all you can eat sushi" you may consider the lack of quality, and if so you've never been to yama sushi. A quaint little place nearly hidden, in a shopping center. But oh ohhh oh the lovelyness that comes with this place.Great customer service; as soon as you sit down,either at the bar or at a table a waitress is there to take your drink order bring you chopsticks and an individually packeged moist towlette. once you announce "all you can eat" they bring you all the fix'ns including a nice bean sprout salad to start. Then hand you two menus one of regular rolls and one of specialty rolls and sit back and wait for you to order rolls the make right in front of you(kinda,behind the bar,but close). specialty rolls are most fun, so i went for for it and was not disappointed. All the rolls i tried where DE-liscious! loaded with flavors of garlic and spicyness creative mixes with fun names.6 rolls later i was down for the count, the nice man tried to offer me ice cream but I had to refuse,there was still taki staring me in the face and i had to get that down first.... i was full for hours but didn't regret one minute of it. the 25 bucks i spent was well worth it considering i ate 6 rolls and@ 7-9 bucks a pop it was totally worth it.  Do IT!

      First of all based on the reviews here,  I went last night and had the all you can eat for $22.99 which is cheap for dinner.  I just want to say i personally label myself as a all you can eat sushi guru. my friends and i work for the airlines so its a 1 hour free flight to las vegas and las vegas seem to have the most all you can eat sushi bars.  I was by myself and which is customary for me before i bring the whole gang. I sat at the bar.  Service: the waitresses were friendly and attentive. Now the sushi chef was okay i dont blame him but you dont know who's gonna be the big tipper. there was an attractive young lady at the bar before i got there he was very attentive to her but a little slow and no rec commendations which he offered her.  i got two menus one with specialty rolls- basically all spicy tuna concoction , california roll stuff and fried shrimp stuff. thats all i saw nothing special. now the other menu had traditional nigiri and regular rolls you would finds just about anywhere with a list of appetizers.  1. i started out with a spicy tuna roll with eel on top, the roll size was perfect. the spicy tuna was a little fishy and the eel was not very buttery and little fishy also. after that i thought i'd try the nigiri sushi and see if anything stands out.  1. halibut was decent but the texture on the rice of the nigiri sushi was a little bit hard. 2. giant clam decent 3. sweet shrimp i could tell it was just thawed 4. two orders of garlic tuna decent cause of the sauce 5. two orders of salmon fresh, they were advertising this on a sign as i walked in on a little side walk sign. 6. ika --not fresh 7. taco very dry 8. seaweed salad decent  9. miso soup salty for my taste and came out lukewarm 10 finished with green tea ice cream, cant go wrong with ice cream i think this was the best part of the meal.  it was cheap and worth a try, it had few strikes when i walked it. First I'm korean nothing against my peeps but most sushi bars owned by koreans in my experience are skimpy on the fish and the texture of the rice for some reason is never any good. this place is korean owned. Second when i walked in i was the only asian customer beside the workers.   Too bad sushi house manda closed cause of the smoking law it was in a bar, that place was good. Also Koto was very good but they went out of business i dont know why it was a great restaurant which should have charged more.  I will keep searching las vegas for the best all you can eat sushi bar. Let everybody know. by the way i had gone to Oshyi La's week that way better that yama.

      Worth it just to hear the cute Korean waitress tell us the names of the rolls we ordered...  Sun of the Beach...Man Whore...Kiss the Asss!  Yeah, totally worth it....  The sushi is decent and the price is right.

      When im in the "Lost Wages" for work (not for PAIN)  I try to come here every once in a while. Last night was once in a while...  Once again ill break it down simple  SERVICE was attentive not obnoxious attentive but good attentive. FOOD was decent sushi but there is one thing that is special here and no where else...read on Yelpers...  I usually order the all you can eat dinner for 23.00 and I get Giant Clam - A bit below standard Sweet Shrimp - Standard Uni - Standard Salmon Skin Roll - Standard but they put the SWEET EEL sauce on it so you have been warned. Yellowtail - Standard Halibut w/Ponzu sauce - Standard Miso Soup - Tasted pretty good but like the person before me mentioned-lukewarm? Wassup wit that?!?!? Salad (x2) - Dressing is pretty tasty and the main reason I go here.......................... DYNAMITE Im a big fan of the ol' JAPANESE SEAFOOD PIE but there is a twist here... The owners are KOREAN (Im not big on the whole JAP vs KOR sushi thing, if you make good sushi I dont care if you are AFRICAN, Good is Good no matter the nation) The reason I note this is beacause the DYNAMITE is flavored much differently than any other DYNAMITE I have ever tasted. NOW I wont go out and say its the BEST EVA....but its pretty darn good. The best I can describe it as - Peppery with Mayo cream FUNK and the SIRICHA just to FREAK IT!!!  Made with giant clam, scallops, chopped onions and diced mushrooms this dish is UNIQUE TASTING!!!  Pretty much everything is standard Sushi, but what really keeps me coming back is the DYNAMITE. If you like DYNAMITE give this place a try and you might like it. Overall a pretty decent choice.  Eat Drink and be FUNKY!!!

      So after photographing the first day of the AVN Expo, I got the urge for sushi (no pun).   I passed by this placed since it was next door to a CVS and I needed batteries.  Okay, I really wanted was just fish. Not rolls. Just cut fish. Sashimi and sushi.  The maguro was a bit frozen and pale. The sake lacked in luster but the hirame and hamichi (kudos).  Luckily, it was AYCE and I took advantage of it. They even had uni and sweet shrimp as part of the deal. I had the bar, so the cuts came on coming. I wish they had ankimo though. ugh!  Good sushi is never a roll.

      Wet Dream, Man Whore, Kiss the Ass...  No I'm not talking about another Vegas strip club adventure, but the best all you can eat sushi in LV for the money.  These are the names of some of the creative and more popular rolls in case you were wondering.  Premium Sushi. All You Can Eat. Great Deal!  Atmosphere: Yama Sushi is located off the strip and hidden next to a CVS within an Albertson's parking lot.  This secret gem is one of the places that I visit whenever I'm in town and I'm always sure to bring along my friends...and so far all have given the thumbs up!  The restaurant is small, but depending on what time you arrive finding a seat is not a problem.  The decor is what you expect, nothing more and nothing less.  Staff: Very friendly and attentive.  Sushi is served quick and fast.  Appetizers are also made to order and delivered in a timely manner.  The sushi chef's are all well trained.  Jun the manager is the man!  I highly recommend sitting at the bar in front of him and asking for him to surprise you with his tasty secret treats.  Food: Let me say this again...the sushi is premium.  Not the crap you find at other chain sushi spots like Niko Niko.  This is why you gotta love Vegas and the daily drops of the freshest of the fresh fish from around the world.  The AYCE menu consists of everything from appetizers, salads, soup, sushi, handrolls, cut rolls, and dessert.  Yes you can get as much red bean, green tea ice cream or mango mochi as you want!  All the appetizers are yummy.  I especially like the bbq ribs, the soft shell crab, and the hamachi kama.  These alone give you your money's worth!  I've been to this place many many times over the last 5 years and my favorite sushi is the "Sexy Salmon" just like a normal salmon sushi, but with a thin slice of lemon, jalapeno, and ponzu sauce.    **Tip 1: If you don't want to fill yourself too fast try ask for a 1/2 order of the rolls instead.  This gives you about 4 pieces of the roll rather than 8.  **Tip 2: If you feel adventurous or enjoy a good handroll ask for one of their specialty rolls, but as a handroll i.e. the TNT roll as a handroll.  If you're there and sit by the bar try to find my business card...hint it's the only bright red one with a thumbprint on it.

      Yama is one of the best sushi places ever. A friend recommended it and we went there for all you can eat. everything is delicious and the staff is super friendly.  i do however, not recommend going in close to closing at all though. we felt a little rushed like they were trying to get us out.  besides that, everything was great.

      Previously my wife and i had been living in the town of Lancaster in California, while there we got addicted to an all-you-can-eat sushi bar called Big Tuna. Best place we have ever been, excellent sushi, excellent service, excellent ambiance. Since moving to Vegas though we have been searching and searching for a place that comes close to matching it, and while we have not yet found such a place we both agree Yama Sushi comes decently close.   The sushi is well made and comes to you fairly quickly. While we have been to some locations where the sushi comes back to us at room temperature (ick) the sushi here is still nice and cool. My personal favorite is the garlic tuna, while my wife's favorite is the baked green mussels. The rolls are all pretty good, we have yet to find one we didn't really enjoy, though I do suggest being careful with anything that has cream cheese because it can be overpowering. Oh! And it is all you can eat desserts as well! Love mochi? Get as much as you like!  Downsides? I hate it when you order a soda and they give you a can, especially at an all-you-can-eat place. I generally just stick with a water then. Also, sitting at the bar for any real length of time can be murder on your butt, but it is the best place to be for the all-you-can-eat sadly.   All in all this is the best place for sushi my wife and I have found in Vegas so far, and we have tried quite a few. Don't go towards closing hour and it should be a excellent experience!!

      This place holds a special place in my heart! I have to say it was my first sushi restaurant that I have ever tried when I moved to Las Vegas not too long ago. I became friendly with the owner as I ate lunch there almost everyday for 2 weeks. It was everything I was looking for in NYC but could not find there. The price was just right and the food was always prepared quickly and served and presented wonderfully. It is my local spot for sushi whenever I have the craving. I have introduced many of my friends there and they have become just as loyal as I have. Jun is the manager and he is very popular with the repeat guests. I love their food and their service. It never changes and I love it whenever it is so packed that you have to wait to get a table or a bar seat. It has become almost like family to me and I will always continue to go and support their wonderful business. They cater to the people and it comes back to them 10 fold. Their basis is to serve quickly and politely. I never once had to ask to have my water refilled. The waitresses are all so very attentive and they deserve a hefty tip every time. For those not giving them a good review, give them another shot. They never disappointed me and I have been there over 30 different times.

      This restaurant specializes in rolls, which I like, because they are filling. This place is definitely a quantity over quality setup. The quality of the fish was not bad, but you can definitely get fresher stuff at a more traditional place. My favorite roll was the rainbow roll with big pieces of tuna, salmon, avacado and shrimp.  The thing that sold me about this place was that it has an all you can eat option. You can order as many rolls as you want for around $23. That means that since most rolls cost in the $10 range, if you eat two rolls, you basically get your money's worth. Between my friends and I, we had eight rolls.   It certainly is not the best sushi quality in the world, but for the price, it can't be beat!

      I really love this place. Everytime I've eaten here, they've been nothing but friendly and accomidating. The last time I went was a few days ago, I took my cousins (one who was 5yrs old, btw) to go eat there. I usually like to go before 3pm rolls around cause that's when the All You Can Eat is about $20.   They brought our rolls out fairly quickly and even brought my little cousin a separate bowl of rice that isn't on their menu, atleast I didn't see it on there, as well as two orders of Mochi at the end when we only had to pay for one. I think this place has a great atmosphere when dining with friends and now I think their atmosphere is great for families as well.  Definitely recommended!

      All you can eat - just keep ordering off the menu. The rolls are great and the uni was excellent. The sushi was not as great as my favorite place but it was just as good as most sushi places, and the soft shell crab was top notch. But in particular, they do a top qualify shrimp tempura. Service was extremely friendly and they didn't mind that the kids made a huge mess (and they ate a lot which doesn't always happen)  Much better than some of the big hotel buffets we went to.

      Yama Sushi was a life saver.  We first got turned around by our cabbie who was supposed to take us to the chain restaurant "Kabukis" south of Mandalay Bay.  Instead we got sent to Kabukis east of the strip.  By the time we found out we were in the wrong place, the cab had left and a couple of us were about to go into alcohol shock from drinking at the pool all day.  We struck out across the expanse of Las Vegas roadways to find somewhere to eat some type of raw fish.  We ambled into a strip mall across the street and found Yama.  The service was a little slow, but that is the only unfavorable thing that I could say about this place.  They still served us even though not one of us had a BAC of under .15%.  We did the all you can eat sushi deal, and the food kept coming until we were all fairly coherent again.    The variety of rolls was great and just what we needed.
