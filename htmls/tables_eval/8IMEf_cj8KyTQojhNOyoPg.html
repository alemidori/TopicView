      The Rio is more often frequented by the high-rollers in Las Vegas... but back in the day it had the best buffet (now its been out-done by newer casinos) and it had the swankiest lay-out. Nowadays, it is a pretty cool place to hang out or a cool place to stay. All the room shere are suites, so although the average room price is a little steep,  every room here is nice. I think this is a good place to stay for busy holidays because its slightly off-strip and because the rooms are affordable for what they are.

      This is not a good choice for gambling but the Rio is a great place to drink eat and party. The seafood buffet is great,although the price has risen to the point where I would only go there if I'm winning. Which I never am. The other buffet is massive,in fact it's TOO big,with too much lacklustre food and not enough quality. I never thought I would say a buffet could be TOO big,but this one is. One good thing is when you're standing in line you can watch the bikini-clad blackjack dealers nearby. The Mardi Gras theme works here--in fact it's alot more effective here than at the Orleans,which is themed inside and out. There are always lots of young "hotties" at this place,the kind of women who think they're hot but actually they're not. If you like silicone and way too much makeup this is the place for you. The male equivalent is here in force as well. That aside,the Rio is a good choice if you're in Vegas to party.

      the hotel itself? not so bad. but to party/club? it's a lot of fun. my friends and i went to a KID CAPRI show there... the layout was awesome and the vibe was pretty cool. more of a hiphop scene... which is my thing. it doesn't feel so crammed- that's why i like the club.

      They definitely take their liberties with the definition of the word "Suite."  It was a nice hotel room:  spacious, comfy bed, etc. . . . just don't call it a Suite on the travel website.  Food was decent and the sports book area nice (esp. the VIP area with lazy boys), but it (as well as the Palms) are a bit off the main drag which is fine if you want to stay there the whole time.

      The Rio Suite Hotel and Casino is one of the more successful casinos off the strip. With the success of the 2 buffets the hotel and casino continues to draw in crowds of all ages. Gaming here can be expensive; however, the party atmosphere will make you want to sit down a throw a few dollars away.  The rooms are extremely large which is great when you have a big group of friends.  Not that you would even think about breaking the 4 person per room policy here.  People who care for a view of the strip will pay top dollars to sleep.  People who don't care for a view will see the not so beautiful side of Vegas.  Then again, if you're sharing a room with 8 other drunk guys and sleeping on the floor, who cares what the view is like right?

      This is a review about the hotel, not the casino, or the shows, or the food.  Keep it in mind folks.  This is a great convention hotel.  Really, it's about a 3.5 star place, because the rooms are ample sized, the staff was attentive, and check in and check out, the people were very polite and helpful.  It's off the strip, and really, it should be half a star deduction for the location, but they've made a point of having shuttles to the strip for as long as I can remember.  Also, the rooms are pretty reasonable if you book early enough.    If you're going for a honeymoon in Vegas, first, don't!  There has to be a better place you can afford. If not...I did see the honeymoon suite on my last trip and well, it's opulent.  And very private.  Just think of the wrongness that could go on in that place!

      Definitely seemed like the most adult of the hotel/casino's... Chippendale's plus flying strip show, plus strip stage on main casino floor...  I would not advise going with children, but would probably be great with a group of friends. Also with the right kind of couple.  But I didn't go in the hotel area.  Also not particularly close to the other casinos.

      To me, it was a great hotel and a great hotel suite. In the room, the TV has the AV connections open so if you bring a DVD player, you won't be disappointed that there's a block where the AV connections should be. I've been here 3 times and the first 2 times, there was a window in the shower so you can see the TV when you're taking a shower. The hole is not big enough or low enough as to people seeing you. I'm not 21 yet, but my dad didn't like the casino because the minimum bets at the Blackjack tables were $25. And of course, their renowned buffet is awesome. I would come here again.

      The "suite" was pretty nice. You do have to use that term loosely. I mean, it's a big room with a sectional sofa. Mini-bar, mini fridge, and bathroom lighting that makes you look like a movie star. However, the aren't all "suites". No wet bar, no jacuzzi, and no seperate room. But I can't complain, it was comped.  If you gamble, always show your Total Rewards card. It's an easy way to get free rooms every time.   Rio's got some life. I used to stay at Bally's and Paris exclusively. But the Rio was way better, and younger. It's a place for 30-somethings. Every cocktail server also dances or sings. Plus they also have girls offering massages while you play. Bitchin'!  One complaint. Paper thin walls. When you wake up at 5:00am to the sound of a hooker earning her baby's diapers in the "suite" next door, you laugh for a second, till your head splits wide open from the hangover.

      SUPER DUPER SUITE UPGRADE !!!  Leaving Las Vegas can be hard, especially after all the free booze, gambling, and late night trips to the tittie bars, but when your flight home is delayed until the next day, now that sucks. That's happened to me and some buddies, so we decided to go back to the Rio and see if we could get a room for the night. Once the Rio heard what happened, they set us up in one of the phattest suites I've seen. Dude we are talking about a giant suite with a huge living room with 2 huge sofas and a couple of extra chairs, dining table for 8, a wet bar with a sink, fridge, queen size beds in the bedroom, Jacuzzi tub, glass shower that was  also a steam room, complimentary  fruit/cheese basket, and plasma TV's everywhere !!! We were living the "suite" life

Ugghhh...the servers wear ugly neon color bikinis and ignore if women order...so my dear friend and I decided it was time to use our women powers.  "nice to meet you...oh thank you for the drink homie."  Finally, we get service around here...just not from the servers.  Oh well, now it's free!

      This is f'ing vegas! where's the glitz? where's there magic? where's the service? Definately not and the rio- damn, i've been trapped here for work for 3 days and i can't wait to get the f out. Lets count the ways. First, there's NOWHERE to get food in this place? Yah, the restaurants seem to be there, but either their not open, or you can't just grab something to eat and get back to the gambling at hand. Allright, demerits for the food, lets try the amenities. ohh where to beging...shabby faded 80s carpet? Check! Dodgy facility upkeep? Check! Pool that's never open? Check! Workout room that costs 22 freakin bucks for NO FREEWEIGHTS and is smaller than an airplane bathroom? Definately check. and the service? don't even get me started.  With the hopes of trying to swim, i went to the pool today at 6pm to find it closed. Why I asked the attendant? Oh, we were losing money today because no one was drinking at the bar, so we had to send the lifeguards home, so the pool is closed. Can i swim without the lifeguards i ask- the answer: only if i want to be escorted out by security. Now THAT is service. Avoid the rio at all costs.

      First of all Rio is off the strip.  Not much glitz and glamour about this place.  Considering it's Vegas it is a bit on the lack luster side.  One upside is the rooms are huge!  It looks like a condo almost.  We had two connecting rooms and it perfectly accommodated a dozen inebriated grown men.  The bathrooms were clean and the beds we comfortable.  We had three couches combined on all two rooms with a dining table that we filled with beers, snacks, and liquor.  They had two excellent buffets downstairs. We opted for the classic buffet and for the price of $26, it was well worth it.  Go for the prime rib and the sirloin steak if you love meat.  They also had a section of decent Chinese food.  They have a 24-hour cafe that serves steak and eggs and good burgers.  One huge upside for me was they had a Coffee Bean right off the elevators.  One star got knocked off for the pools.  It was so SAD!  They closed really early for a Saturday and the music selection was horrible.  Plus it feels weird to swim around with beers next to the kiddies enjoying their summer vacation.  The only way I will return here is if I had to accommodate a huge party.  Other than that, my business needs to go elsewhere.

      ...i thought i heard an echo when i yelled for no reason just to see if the room is really that big.  in reality, no echo, but i startled the cleaning lady..!!  ya the room was pretty big but the lackluster decor didn't give me goosebumps of any type.  but hey, no one ever sleeps in Vegas, right?  unless you have 'someone' with you and you're tired from showing off and performed your God-given talents (you know what i mean).  the view wasn't that bad either facing the Flamingo Rd. looking towards the strip, and like any other Vegas hotels, the large window pane had me one time or another, the notion of stripping down to my bare butt and see if anyone would notice my butt cheeks planted against it.  since there were plenty of room, they had another sink in addition to the the restroom as well as a small fridge.  definitely a plus if you have more people in the room.  the shower was pretty good and i love the powerful spout the shower head provides.  one weird part: there is a small window you can peek out or for someone to peek in while showering.  well, i guess it's nice if you are with your girlfriend or boyfriend and have yourselves kinky moments, but since i was with one of my buddies,  we just watched tv and resent the fact why there weren't any girls with us....

      I like the Rio when not on business.  I like the rooms, pool area (smaller and more intimate), the shows, etc. all right there.    Might not be the Palms or Hard Rock, but a great place all the same.  Give those places some time ... they will fade and something else will pop up there.

      So I met this music manager thru my work...he was so fun to talk to and seemed to have a really strong spirit.  He was telling me about an upcoming tour that I should be a part of.  hmmm...I was thinking..maybe, sounds like a great opportunity.  So me and two of my girls went to Vegas to meet his manager and check out his artists.    When we arrived we were not pleasantly surprised by this old dude that had another agenda in mind.  One of his artists was a friend of mine and spoke highly of him and the opportunity, but little did anyone know he was just a PERVE!!  So we arrived at the Rio...Maral was so excited she stuck her body out of her huge car to capture a picture of the Prince sign on the building.  The lobby was okay, we couldn't get into the club for free, and the company outside of this douche bag was wonderful.  He wanted us to stay in his room...whatev!!   So we got a room on our own and enjoyed it sooo much.  The room was HUGE!! and the facilities new like...and we just had a blast.  Got some liquor from a liquor store and had a wonderful party.  Made new friends, went dancing, got caught in traffic, and made new memories with the most amazing gals alive.  Thank you Connie and Maral...I love you!  Such amazing support they gave me that weekend.  And it was delightful Connie's bday!  :)  So all in all, it was an amazing trip, although what brought us there was sooo sad.  We left with smiles and great memories.

      This is a spectacular hotel casino.  Yes, it is off the Strip, but hey, it has everything here and you may not need to venture off to Las Vegas Boulevard!  Fabulous free show, fantastic rooms.  But if you just got to get to the Strip, they do have a shuttle bus that will take you to Harrahs.

      I just got back from my second stay there.   It's a nice hotel.   It is all suites which works out well since there were 4 guys sharing one room.   We had enough room to move around and get around and store our luggage.    It is off the strip, but if you rent a car, it's not so bad.   I will be back again next year.

      When the heck did the Masquerade in the Sky just become a bunch of ho's flirting with my boyfriend? Didn't the dancers used to be Mardi Gras-themed? Got plenty of beads (although most were given to me by my boyfriend, who caught a lot of them from the pretty dancers who fell in love with him)... also found a $3 Fabulous Las Vegas sign t-shirt here, yay. There was an announcement that there would be a parade at 4 pm, then there wasn't one until 6 pm. Nothing like waiting around for nothing. Left, then came back later in the night.

      Ok, the last time I went to Rio was gosh knows when.. I think it was like 10 years ago. As I arrive to Vegas I reminisce on how much i use to pig out at Rio cuz of the 1000s of variety of food they had back in the days when they called themselves World of Buffets. I was starving and couldn't think of what to eat during lunch time..and I remember Rios buffet was pretty awesome when they opened up like in the early 90s. The last time I went was like 2000s and it was really lousy and the food just seem like Circus Circus. But this time it was shockingly good.Could be new management or something.. Everything seems fresh.. I thought I was in another hotel. Best part is the real hanging duck they had in they're Chinese section.. they also had roast pork..also the prime rib is to die for.. the clam strips super yum..hush puppies.. pretty good... pretty good...

      Back in the days when I had to pay for a hotel stay, Rio was no doubt my choice for a hotel.  What can I say, I need my space and it was the only all-suites hotel.  Granted it was off the strip (which is why you can really find some bargain price at certain times of the year), but the free shuttle bus which takes you to Harrah's ( and now Caesars and Bally's) is convenient and saves you the hassle of having to find parking.    Now that I have so many hotels to choose from for free, I don't stay at the Rio as much.  And with the other hotels updating their rooms to ultra modern with cool shower fixtures, Rio's room just seems so..........unattractive.    Maybe I am spoiled now and I can no longer stand the water-saving shower head at the Rio.  To make matters worse, it ran out of hot water (it was only lukewarm) by the time I woke up at noon!  I practically shivered the whole time I was in the shower!  What the heck!  How can a hotel run out of hot water???  Then the other time, I woke up to the sound of dripping water!  Holly crap!  It had started raining and our room was leaking.  I couldn't believe it!  It took me a few minutes to find the leak and I called the front desk.  They sent someone to look at it.  but all he could do was placing some towels by the window.  I was too tired to move and thankfully the rain stopped the next day.    I still go there to play and the free buffet at the World Carnival Buffet is fine when I feel like pigging out, but I haven't stayed there in many many months.  I am wishing very  very hard that they will start renovating their rooms like they are doing with Paris and Flamingo.    After all, I do like Suites!

      Wow, this place was HUGE!   My first time in Vegas! I LOVED the line to check in. I was so super excited to get into bed with my (now ex) boyfriend and they make me WAIT IN LINE!??!?  Their room was pleasantly nice...it was a suite. And it took forever to get to. It's a good thing I was sober, because I would have had one helluva time (like I did later on that night). They had a vanity mirror so I could apply makeup better, and notice all the lip hairs I forgot to pluck out thus asking my (then) boyfriend if he could notice them which probably perpetuated the cheating that commenced later that night.  The bed was so COMFY! Yah know, before I got kicked out and all.  oh, and fuck you very much for charging me an ungodly amount of money for a FUCKING LIGHTER AND PACK OF CIGARETTES.

      How old is the Rio? It makes me think of the 80s.  I was here for a conference and according to the fellow conference goer, staying at the Rio makes you feel like the kid stuck outside while all the fun is happening inside. And I have to agree.  By that, I mean, the Rio isn't that close to anything else, but close enough that the taxi drivers get all complainy at the small fare to take you anywhere else and they purposely drive like crap to let you know, in that passo-aggro way that they really do not like you. The Rio is also kinda tacky and the place is always in your face. Sure, isn't Las Vegas supposed to be in your face? Maybe, but once my taxi slowed down enough to push me out the door of other hotels, I got the feeling of more elegance and calm. But not at the Rio and their "bevertainers".  The pluses: so all-encompassing that just about everything I would need is here. Er, except elegance and calm. But everyhing else.  The minuses: confusing reservations and check-in. They ask me if I want two queens or one king, I ask for one king and they say sure. Actual room assigned is 2 queens. They asked if I wanted high speed internet. I say yes. They give me a room that doesn't have high speed internet.  Random wanks: the tv faces nothing. You can't really watch it from the bed, or from the sofa. I had to watch my Walker, Texas Ranger from the side. It didn't make the show any better.  They only give you conditioning shampoo. Bleh, I hate that. My shampoo and conditioner needs to be distinctly separate, and it's really not easy to bring my own thanks to airline restrictions.  Oh, and this place costs beaucoup bucks to stay in. AUGH!

      I visited Las Vegas in the off-season (February) and found that it's one of the best times to go. It's not crowded and a lot easier to get around through the crowds both in the hotels and on the streets.   Rio was a decent hotel, though I would probably try to stay elsewhere in the future. The beds are comfy, the towels nice and full, and the water pressure is so good it almost shoots you through the wall like Kramer in that one episode of Seinfeld. The room service was tricky though, as the three times we called down for it they were operating on a 1-2 hour wait. We only ate at the Grand Buffet and the American Grille. Both places were just ok for where and what they are. Nothing great.  The pool area was lovely for lying in the sunshine, but I imagine gets crowded with a full hotel. The desk and bell staff were all very friendly and helpful, as were most of the food servers. Every single person greeted me with a 'hello' as I passed them in the halls, from the housekeeping staff to the bellmen and room service servers.   Everything is expensive, and that's a bummer (but I guess it's like that in a lot of the Strip area). $14 for an Amstel Light and a Bloody Mary, for example.

      I gotta say, I was enormously happy with the hotel.  We were six people in one room, and we all fit--quite comfortably I might add.  Granted, if we were six girls, we may have had a problem with the bathroom, but at least there's a sink outside the bathroom.  The water pressure was fantabulous!!  It's not often I enjoy showering at a hotel.  The sofa bed was comfortable enough for a sofa bed.  (I was confined there the second night, since I had apparently kicked and punched and scratched my sister the night before in the bed.)  There was still enough space in the room for a rollaway bed.  So, all in all, really roomy, really comfy, and really convenient.  A coffee maker in the room would have been nice, but oh well, we survived.  Also the covers on their pillows need to be longer, or better tucked-in.  Your face scrapes into the mosquito-netting, burlap covering they use on the inside of the cover.  Not so great in the middle of the night.

      Little strange, but let me start with the bathroom....it was the best hotel bathroom I've stayed in.  The towels were really high quality, the shower was fancy and everything was exceptionally clean...I'm a germaphobe which is challenging enough in Vegas.  You may need GPS to find your way around your room because it will be HUGE.  You won't need navigation to find Voodoo.  There is a Voodoo restaurant that is excellent (I'll review that separately) and a Voodoo Lounge where you can get smashed on the roof with a great view.  Both are a short elevator ride back to your room.     The staff was very polite, check in was a breeze and the casino is nice and great bathrooms.  With some updating in the rooms and casino this could be the 5 star it probably was 7-8 years ago.
