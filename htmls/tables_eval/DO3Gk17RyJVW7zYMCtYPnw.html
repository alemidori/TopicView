      Forget this is Bobby Flay's restaruant -- it's great! Our large 13 person party enjoyed a 3-hour lunch, simply decadent and never feeling rushed. Although the food was spectacular, our server was the highlight of the meal. She was very knowledgeable and involved, selecting excellent Spanish wines to pair with the food and offering suggestions for dessert and side dishes.

      Good cooking techniques, creative presentation, but boring sauces that lack variety with fancy names, smokey flavour in the shrimp cakes will remind you of ball park hot dogs.  Exception was the shrimp tamale - quite tasty.  PS Bobby nothing personal but dancing on the cutting board didn't add any flavours to the food.

      Mesa Grill, is Bobby Flay's restaurant. Like it name-sake, it sucks. I'm sorry but just because he's on the food network doesn't mean anything. Maybe, I'm the only person that feels this way but I only came here to see if maybe that although he's such a tool on TV, "He has to be a good chef/ restauranteer, right?" No. The answer is a resounding, "No." There are so many good eats in Vegas... especially at this price range, so I suggest you end up there instead.

      I have to say I enjoyed the food, we both had steak. The thing was, it was literally the WORST dining experience i've ever had. First of all we had a reservation and waited for a table when it wasn't busy. Then we got seated and had to ask for a wine list after sitting for 5 minutes. Then we ordered sparkling water (which i don't really care about but it was my fiance's birthday!) and they brought us tap water. We ordered a nice bottle of wine but had to flag our server down to order, then to get bread, then to get our plates cleared, and then for the bill...and we were patiently waiting the whole time (i don't want my food spit in) Then the couple next to us decided to go through a divorce...I mean it. They were screaming at each other and the husband decided to get up and leave, he was totally piss drunk and stumbling. Then he came back only to greet the friends they were meeting and pretend they were okay. But the entire time they were screaming and yelling and the waiters at the station right behind them didn't say a word to them about their profanity, their volume or anything while we were spending over $100 and trying to have a romantic dinner. Totally ridiculous service...but the food was good. Better places to go.

      I am a big Bobby Flay fan and was excited to eat at his restaurant.  I was with a buddy on business, so we just sat at the bar.  The service was poor, my steak was well-done (I ordered medium), and the wine that was recommended was fair.    Maybe cut one of your three shows on FoodTV and spend some time in Vegas training your staff.

      Wow, I'm surprised at the wide range of experiences people have had at this place.  I went with friends last year, and until this year I thought it was the best steak I'd ever had.  It was cooked to perfection and had a really nice pepper rub that must have left a crust an inch thick.  If you're not into peppery crusts, then you might find the cow at this place not to your liking.  Anyway, the steak was great, the desserts were yummy, the side dishes were  average (as all sides seem to be in Vegas), the ambiance was not bad, and I can't remember what I had to drink during the meal.  As for the service, we had to wait a bit past our reserved time but the waitstaff performed in a prompt and satisfactory manner.  (That sounds kinda dirty, doesn't it?)  The restaurant was definitely crowded and loud, though.  Can't win 'em all, but I sure can deduct a star here and there...!

      I was excited to eat here, due to all the hype of the restaurant.  As I had Saturday brunch here, reservations were no problem.  The food is tasty. I admit.  I had the salmon quesadillas, with salmon roe for appetizers and scrambled eggs with jalapenos and ham.  My only complaint was that they couldn't make my eggs with all egg whites or egg substitute, as the waiter said that the chef would not do it. I would assume that they would try to accommodate with my request, but they didn't. I guess customer satisfaction is not a top priority here.

      I totally agree with Andrew W. on this one.  The food was just not up to par for the price.  The service was great - our server was hospitable.  Our only complaint on the service was that we waited forever to get the bill in order to pay.   To get the reservation was a feat in itself.  We were near the restaurant so we went to the host stand to make reservations for the next day.  We were told to go through the Caesars Dining Reservation System, which practically wanted us to sign our life away before giving us the reservation.

      I've been here twice and both times, the food was wonderful. I was actually surprised at their portions because for a trendy-ish, celebrity chef run restaurant the sizes are pretty small and ridiculousy expensive. but it wasn't frou-frou at all, our waiter was great and can't wait to eat there again!

      I am a Food Network fan so wanted to try this place even though I have never really liked Bobby Flay or his shows. I have to say though, that since eating at Mesa Grill I almost feel a friendly bond between Bobby and I just because the food was so good. When I visited it was for Sunday brunch. Everything from the breads placed on our table to the Cesar salad, to the french fries, to the smoked prawn cakes, everything was beyond good. There wasn't much on the menu, at least for Sunday brunch, but I am glad I didn't pass up food this good just because the selection was small.

      I never really liked Bobby Flay because he's a big d*ck on Iron Chef but after going to Mesa Grill I have a little bit more respect for the guy who puts corn chips in all his dishes.  I ordered the Pork Tenderloin that was delicious. Everyone at our dinner party enjoyed themselves and were even tempted to lick the sauce off their plates!! Of course they had an extensive wine list... but you should order their Mojito.. it was excellent!  The service was okay... the place is practically full every night and they were obviously under staff.

      I had an amazing dinner here and next time I'm in Vegas I will eat here again!  We got there a bit early to grab a seat at the bar and try the Margarita's. The bartender David was super cool and very knowledgeable. We tried a couple different tequila's, as they have a good selection. He gave us a few recommendations on the menu and he was right on. Very cool guy! We had the squash blossoms for an app and they are very tasty. The sauce had amazing flavor. I had the huge NY steak and it was perfect. The homemade steak sauce was so good. It also came with a twice baked potato, tasty. B-friend  had the pork tenderloin and it was the best ever. Huge cuts and it also was served with two great sauces. Food had so much flavor! Service was very good and the decor is nice. Seating is a bit tight and you do need a reservation. You can eat at the bar, but there are only like 8 seats. I could not have been any happier! Very nice wine list too!!

      if you can just get away from the whole Bobby-Flay-hating thing, this place is pretty good... they use the most amazing sauces in the most amazing ways... in fact, i think they pretty much just coat everything in the kitchen in sauce and then send it out.  even the silverware is tasty, it probably has residual sauce stuck between the tines.

      Visited with a group of 7.   Visited Mesa Grill 7/7/06 at 9pm. It was a weeknight.  Food: 4 stars Decor: 5 stars Very trendy, cow hide chairs. casual vibe. Service: 5 stars They were attentive and removed plates properly. When my BF didnt touch his entree they noticed and took it off. Cost: 4 stars. way pricey yo.    Ordered: Sophie's Chopped Salad with her own Special Dressing + Crispy Tortillas 12. This was good, but hell, i can get this anywhere Spicy Tuna Tartare with Blistered Serrano Chile Hot Sauce + Avocado Relish 14. one of the best  ive ever had. this one was demolished in 3 minutes, fer serious. New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin with Bourbon-Ancho Chile Sauce + Sweet Potato Tamale with Crushed Pecan Butter 31. This was my dish. good portions. love love love the tamale. it was sweet and moist.  Yellow Corn Crusted Chile Relleno Filled with Wild Mushrooms + Goat Cheese + Served with a Salad of Grilled Vegetables with White Truffle Oil 23. this was instantly rejected by my BF and he loves chile rellenos. Southwestern Fries-$7  these were tasty enough but $7 squash blossoms- deepfried and gooood. only came with 2 or 3 not enough to share. Quesadilla- overly cheesie. strangely sub par.  Pros: the sweet potato tamale. great pork tenderloin, tuna tartare  Cons: pricey, not many veggie options.  Overall: we couldnt wait to return. i dream about these tamales at night.

      After a long day of work in Las Vegas for business. My coworkers and I decided we wanted to unwind. We chose Mesa Grill, Bobby Flay's restaurant in Las Vegas. Because we had a large group they shoved us into a private room that was dark and uncomfortable. To top it off, it took them at least an hour and a half for the food to come out. I ordered the steak and decided to share it with my coworker because of the large portion. The meat was tough and not seasoned well.  Our waitress was overwhelmed and did not keep her composure. She made it awkward for us the entire time we were there. Everytime we asked for something she made it seem like a big chore. Our meal was expensive and not satisfying at all. I would never return to this restaurant.

      Was here the night after eating at N9NE at the Palms.  Overall pretty good, but not nearly N9NE.  Food was good and service just slightly above average.  Signature pork loin was very good and very spicy, lamb porterhouse outstanding and the queso &amp; blue chip appetizer was very good.

      This place is almost a joke.  This place is about $20-per-plate overrated.  There is no justification in their foofiness and priciness.  Just because you use an open frame to grill something, it doesn't make it good or expensive.  In fact, my veal chop tasted like charcoal.  THAT was unacceptable.  If anything, this place is worth going to experience what recent Vegas dining experience is all about (overrated, expensive food)

      Slash a third off the prices, and you have a very typical San Francisco fusion bistro.  There's nothing wrong with the food here--the grilled pork tenderloin with sweet potato tamale was very memorable.  It's just that among the cheap, smoky, overweight Vegas scene, the high tab comes off as pretentious and affected.

      This Mesa Grill does not live up to the one in NY City. I've eaten here in two occasions: dinner and brunch, and was very disappointed both times. Almost all the dishes I had here were drawn with sauces, I think the sauce should enhance the dish not over powering it. The only dish I would recommend is the Spicy Chicken+ Sweet Potato Hash on their brunch menu@ $16.50(with Avocado, Tomato, Maytag Blue Cheese + Buttermilk Serrano Dressing), the dish was very nicely presented and was also hearty and filling. The other good thing here is their complimentary mini blue corn breads.  I sincerely feel that the chefs at this location should step up to the plate, and really refine their dishes and cooking skills, inorder to meet the standard of the one in NYC.

      i don't just throw out the word "orgasmic" in relation to food lightly because, i mean, not many things in the world can compare to the thing from which that adjective is derived, but the pork tenderloin at mesa grill. the pork tenderloin... oh god... the pork tenderloin......................... mmmmmm yes i am getting excited just thinking about the pork tenderloin at mesa grill. spicy and tender, it melts in your mouth.  and you better savor it. cuz it's like $10 a bite. which is why i knocked off a star, because it's a tad bit pricy.

      Always go to Bobby Flay restaurants for their drinks and appetizers (not entres).  You must try the quesadillas!!!  I still think about them.  The service is wonderful and the food (just the drinks and appetizers) isamazing.

      As Food Network fans, we wanted to check this place out. The set up of the restaurant is really well done. It's spacious and inviting. We were sat up at the top in the back of the restaurant where we could see everything which was very nice. Ordered the Tiger Shrimp +Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale as our appetizer. While it was incredibly good, it is small for the price. The entrees though... oh the ENTREES! I had the Ancho Chile- Honey Glazed Salmon (mouth watering delectible!), my husband had the Coffee Spice Rubbed Rotisserie Filet Mignon (he still talks about it and the sauce!) and my friend had the much loved New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin (out of this world!) Best part was since she was newly pregnant, I got the chance to eat what was left on her plate, yes, even after eating my entire meal! We finished off with dessert which I believe was a flourless chocolate cake. Decadent!!! And I must add that the service was extraordinary. Another friend was trying to mess with the waiter by asking him to bring him bottles of beer that had a SPECIFIC date stamped on them and the server happily accomodated his insane requests! In between this craziness, he checked on us frequently and the plates were removed quickly &amp; easily. I plan to always eat here whenever I'm in the area!

      Don't get the crispy fish that looks at you while you eat it. I guess that's obvious, but it wasn't to us when we ordered it. We really had to pick around the bones and parts of this $30 dish to eat dinner.   We also tried some Yucatan chicken skewers and they were fine, but not worth another trip back. I'd rather eat at a Fuddruckers and keep my $60, thanks.

      Bobby Flay is not my favorite chef to watch on the food network since he mostly does BBQ stuff, but this restaurant was good for your meaty fare and I enjoyed it.  I got a steak and it was perfectly cooked and seasoned great.  My friends all liked their food also.  The only complaint I had was the waiter was a bit odd and seemed to really like one of my friends and kind of liked to loiter around and talk to us a little too much.  But other than that good place for steak.

      Like most of the other reviewers, I felt that the service was quite good because the servers did an excellent job in food recommendations.  We were forewarned that the food would come off a little bit tangy-spicy and had no complaints.  I had the pork tenderloin with sweet potato polenta and it was quite good.  I tried the steak that my friend ordered and it was really really good.  I'm not a big steak person, but it definitely blew me away.  For dessert, I had the warm chocolate cake and it was very rich and GOOD...unless you are not a fan of rich chocolate cakes, you won't be disappointed.

      Full of flavor -- smaller portions  Bobby flay never fails in the flavor department.  Excellent Pork (fairly spicy), very delicious cauliflower still not sure exactly what the creation was but a big plate of it any day of the week would make me smile. The lamb looked great, the chicken tacos were so-so, the signature tamale was not that impressive, but the wine selection was excellent. French fries were pretty good -- seasoned with paprika, salt, and cilantro. The dessert was by far my favorite! Apple pie &amp; the Pear with tequila sorbet *mmm.*  Date Rating: 7 Pick up Scale: 3 (7 on a good night at the bar... you will probably wait for your table)  Strong suggestions: Call ahead for a table.

      I have a love for the kind of food Bobby Flay cooks. So, naturally, this was the place for me to try out his stuff for the first time. This restaurant was close to five stars but the service let me down.  Went as a group of four on a weekend night (with reservations). We still had to wait about 10 minutes but that is not out of the ordinary on a Saturday in Vegas.   The decor of the place is...unique. It's like some kind of post-modern-meets-old-southwest looks with colorful window tiles and earthy toned walls. Odd but cool. Anyways, the food was simply amazing. I can't remember anything I ate except for the Coffee Rubbed New York steak. That's because nothing else really mattered. It was a unique experience for steak and it was simply amazing. The sides that it came with were also amazing...wasabi mashed potatos and aspragus I believe. I loved it.  The one complain was with the service...it took our waiter about 40 minutes to bring us our check at the end of the night..which was enough to ruin it for most of group (I was still happy with the steak). Looking at other reviews, maybe this was a one-time blunder or a rare occurance, but I can only speak to what I saw.  Regardless...good center-Strip location the Caesar's...good decor...and awesome Bobby Flay food!

      If you are looking for great decor and exotic flavors from a celebrity chef, then Mesa Grill is a great fit.  But if you just want good food, then you won't get your money's worth.  Then again, you're in the heart of Vegas when you go to the Mesa Grill at Caesar's Palace, so that shouldn't really surprise you.  PROS: - Good service, great for groups (reservations are a must) - Desserts are very popular, and you can do a sampler for the table  CONS: - Not a good value, but if you are looking for value, then you should be going to a buffet

      What inspired me to go here for my birthday was the fact that I am a pure Food Network junkie.  I decided to have my birthday dinner her with knowing that this was as close to Bobby Flay as I would get.  The atmosphere is nice because you can see the kitchen in action and the overall place is huge!  The staff here is a bit on the snobby side I have to admit.  I slipped twice across the restaurant floor and no one even stopped to see if I was ok.  Talk about a law suit waiting to happen.  The food here was ok.  My mouth always salivates when I watch Iron Chef or any one of his hundreds of shows.  I even saw Mesa's grand opening on the Food Network.  Unfortunately, this place just didn't meet my expectations and doubt that I will ever go back only because the food did not have me wanting to crawl (off the floor) for more.  We ordered a three course meal and could not recommend any of the dishes that I ordered since they weren't that memorable.  The taco appetizer was good, but not OMG good.    TIP: Don't believe the hype.  Skip it.

      Yum Mesa Grill is a really upscale restaurant located at the Caesar's Palace in LV. I ordered their Venisen off the regular menu, medium rare and it was super, super delicious!  Now i never tried venisen before and was told the meat was simliar to lamb and it was quite a good description.  My dish came out on 2 chops, kinda stingy but it was filling to say the least.  The order comes with a mini corn cake on the side, VERY VERY small, a dark brown sauce that is pretty good...a little bit sweat and tangy , but basically the dish is served a la carte.  I would recommend ordering a side of something... my friends got mashed potatoes, some got fries, and another ordered a blue-corn pancake thing that was $14 and not very good..haha.  I had an opportunity to try their NY-Steak $40 on their menu and it was probably the best tasting meats I've ever had.  It was really full of flavor and not blood or running in any way.  I'm sure they let it sit out after cooking to hold in the juices or it was frozen before grilling.  The meat was pretty rare even though it was supposed to be cooked medium.    Overall this place is good, very good, but very expensive.  Be prepared to shell around at least $50 per person.  Like the other reviews, this place is GREAT to bring your girl friend, wife, husband, parents, in-laws....very impressive.
