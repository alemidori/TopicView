      No wonder this hotel was featured in the movie "Vegas Vacation". Between the jungle feel of the casino, the mini-volcano out front and Siegfried and Roy (RIP), this hotel - the first of the Strip mega-resorts - has enough hokey Strip personality (now almost a cliche), to fill ten thousand coin buckets.  The last time I stayed here was five years ago, and I understand from others who've stayed more recently that it has deteriorated but the parent company, MGM Mirage, is planning major renovations.

      Nice hotel and beautiful pool area.  The rooms are pretty decent.  We hit up the Cravings buffet for breakfast/lunch and service was fantastic and the food was decent.  The breakfast food was fantastic; lunch was decent.  The sushi was very bland and full of rice.  The dessert was alright - the oreo cake was just hard and the gelato was mouth-watering.

      I am down to my last 40 dollars. I am sitting at the bar with my brother and a friend when I look down at the end of the bar at an absolutely gorgeous woman in a black dress.She sees me looking and waves. I stupidly look behind me to see who she is waving to. I play another 20  dollars. I am now down to my last 20. I look down at the end of the bar and this beautiful woman waves at me again. This cannot be happening. I stupidly look behind me to see who she is waving at. I still could not figure it out until I saw several people approach her. Holy shit she is a lady of the night. Damn she is hot ! I go for a walk just me and my 20 dollars and after looking around for awhile I see this lady escorting a man up to the elevators. I go back and sit down and play 2 hands of video poker and win a progressive for 4800 dollars. Holy crap I won 4800 dollars. The reason for the 5 stars is 1 -I won 4800 dollars, and 2 - I won this after this Hot,Hot,hot, looking escort left so I kept my money to myself. Not that I am weak willed and an easy target for sinful distractions. Did I mention she was Hot?

      The older MGM brother, there is a little touch of a more mature Vegas here and a bit of refined flavor.  The lush interior was refreshing and the huge aquarium behind the front desk was very cool.  When Jet tried to charge us the full $30 at 2:30 in the morning, we searched for another alternative.  The other lounge we found was playing some head-aching hip hop and the restaurants were closed so we relaxed in the sports bar.  It was a very stately room with high &amp; ornate ceilings, where we sipped decent dirties and planned out our next move.  The Cal King back at our hotel sounded perfect but I'm glad we experienced the resort that kicked off the growth spurt of the Strip we see today.

      The Mirage has a beautfiul, large, refreshing pool with plenty of waterfalls.  Behind that large pool is "Bare."  It's an adult-only pool area that was incredibly fun for two gals looking for some Vegas indulgence (that would be myself and a friend).  You don't need to be bare to enjoy it, but you can go topless if you'd like.

      Bare charges a $10 admission fee, but we got free passes after making purchases at the Mirage swim shop.  They have super comfy lounge chairs and beds with thick, thick mattresses.  They have yummy cocktails, play great music, and change your towels whenever you get up to take a dip.  Now, the Bare pool is NOT refreshing.  It's totally warm (too warm) because it's tiny.  They also have a glass-enclosed jacuzzi area.  The bathroom is fantastic....it's clean, sleek, and offers all sorts of goodies like mouthwash, lotions, etc.  We had a great day sunning ourselves here!

      To wrap up, let me just say I really loved almost everything about The Mirage.  The service was really friendly and we loved eating and drinking at their newest restaurant and lounge, Japonais.  My only complaint is that the rooms are not sound-proofed at all.  Mornings were a little rough with neighbors taking showers, making calls, etc.

      I wish the good ole days of Steve Wynn and the Mirage Reorts were still around.  The Mirage was the most sought after property right after Caesars.  The shows are cool, the landscaping is beautiful and the rooms are very nice.  The downside is that MGM owns them now....

      I didn't stay in this hotel but I did a lot of gambling here for my 21st birthday. I spent more time playing roulette than not. The decor and staff are FANTASTIC. The tram that goes back and forth to Treasure Island helped a lot...when drunk and trying to get back to go to bed. The Jim Beam is great!

      Mirage is one of the first hotels on the Strip. At first I thought it would be some 3 stars hotel. But hey I was wrong.  The pool is so huge with nice design, I loved it when I was floating around. Also many good restaurants are located here.   On top of that, my room got upgraded and we got a very nicccccceee room. Yippee Did I mention the pool??

      You're soooo money! ;) Ahhhh, the Mirage, my favorite of all the Vegas hotels to stay at! Great food, great people, central strip, reasonably priced tables and enough cocktail waitress' going around to keep your buzz going! Who says you have to stay at the Bellagio or the Palms to have a kick ass time in your hotel?   ***Word from the wise though, if you're a guy and you're using a girl to roll your dice for "luck" at a craps table... you better give her some money to play with otherwise we'll crap you out on purpose. Just think about that next time ;)

      I was really excited to stay at Mirage but it was one disappointment after another.  While the Casino is nice and relaxing the rooms were pretty shitty for price.  Our toilet didn't work properly, the decor was out of date, and the furniture was beat up.  In the evening we tried Revolution Lounge, the waitress was friendly, but unattentive, they were not busy at all, so the fact that we were only served one drink an hour was ridiculous.   The interactive tables were fun for about a 30 seconds.  The next night we decided to hang out at Japonais Lounge, the staff was rude, made our drinks wrong, and when I asked for them to correct it, they got attitude, we skipped out on the bill.  Screw them.  What is good about the Mirage?  The Spa has a nice layout, yummy juice drinks, a great steam room and whirlpool, and the staff is attentive.  The Cravings Buffet was delicious, the staff met our every need, and the champagne poured until we couldn't pronounce champagne.  Word to the wise, stay somewhere else but if you're looking for a good brunch or relaxing in a steam room venture over.

      Took hubby here for his birthday in Jan 05'.  Nice rooms, clean marble bathrooms.  The best thing we loved about it was the jungle forest in the casino and the guy feeding the fish in the HUGE fish tank behind the reception desk.  That was fun to see.  The buffet Cravings was wonderful.  Great food. Got so full we sat there for an extra hour.

      I stayed here for my first trip to vegas. LOVED that the tigers and dolphins were here. Nightclub was good. The rooms were ok. My shower was a little dirty. i wasn't in the room much anyhow. The casino was great, busy but not ridiclous. I got a manicure and a pedicure, and it was honestly the best pedi I have ever received. I paid about $70 for it. the restaurants, casinos, bars, shopping, spa.. all that stuff was very clean and very nice. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat.

      I have stayed at most of the Vegas strip hotels and here are my thoughts.  The Mirage in my books is about as standard as you get for a hotel on the strip.  The hotel draws a variety of different people of all ages.  The hotel has undergone many renovations, so you shouldn't experience the transitional phase.  The rooms have a bit of a cabana feel, so it really has that tropical feel.  The pool at the hotel is pretty nice and has a tropical feel to it.  However, there are now some better pools on the strip.  TIP: I think that the hotel front desks bluff by telling you that they have upgraded you to a superior room.  I think that the standard rooms are called superior rooms, so don't be fooled!

      I have stayed at the Mirage many times and have been very satisfied every time.  The best part of the Mirage is location on the strip.  It's right next too the Caesar Forum Shops and just across the street from the Venetian.   Though it doesn't feel the same since Sigfried and Roy ended their shows, it's still nice being able to see the white tigers on display.    I've had good experience gambling here.  I'm a craps player and the dealers have always been very friendly which helps keep the game interesting.

      The Mirage is definitely one of the "older" places to stay on the Strip, but I was pleasantly surprised by the hotel and its prices.  The hotel is a huge labyrinth (as to be expected), but it has all of the necessities - a decent pool (and, of course, a topless pool too), a CPK, a deli, a few clubs, etc.    The rooms were pretty decent - relatively spacious though the bathrooms are a little old.  My friends stayed in the suites which were huge with tons of space - highly recommended for bachelorette parties!

      I stay at Mirage once or twice a year.  I come here for the strip location, spa, gym, and restaurants.  There's also the semi-new Jet nightclub downstairs and a sportsbar to check in on your favorite sports.  Check-in is pretty easy and they also have a vip check-in with a stocked/hosted bar if you roll like that.  A better bang for the buck in my opinion and the rooms are clean and big enough.
