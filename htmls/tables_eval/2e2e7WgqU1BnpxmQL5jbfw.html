      One of the few good, reasonable places to eat in Vegas around Planet Hollywood.  The sandwiches are good and the prices are very reasonable (especially after you lose a few hundred at the casino).. We went there twice and 3 of the 4 sandwiches we tried were really good, one was OK.  Very efficient system also.. you order what you want and they make it fresh very quickly.. Save your money and eat there...

      Very good sandwich. And only costs $6 in Las Vegas. Very cheap price. I love their Hawaiian sandwich and Jamaican jerky sandwich. So tasty. We even went back for another time.  Another restaurant called Hawaiian Tropic is behind it. And we checked the price, it's 3 times higher. And the waitress clothes cloth is 3 times less.

      Wow.  Amazing.  Delicious.  The top three words that come to mind when I think about this place.  I found it by accident while walking through Planet Hollywood on my way down the Strip and it was a great surprise.  I had a turkey club (or something along those lines) and I expected something like you would get at Quizno's.  This is no Quizno's or normal toasted sandwich.  It was the most delicious thing I think I've ever had.  Definitely a good choice.  They have fast service, friendly people, and a wide variety.  I hope they open more of these around the country.  I know they'd be welcome in Atlanta anytime!

      I had a Turkey club and it was just want I need after 3 days of eating food at the convention center--yucky. All the sandos are toasted and fresh. It did take me a while to find the place, but once I did I was immediately satisfied.   Priced well and filling--two things you do not find in Vegas that often. I will be back.

      Damn delicious. Do yourself a favor and try one of these bad boys.  Warm, fresh bread. I had a moozadell and tomato sandwich, and it was orgasmic. My fiance had the roast beef, and said that it was one of the best roast beef sandwiches he's ever had, and he's had a lot. The sister-in-law had the chicken and pineapple sandwich, and it was ridiculously good. She in fact goes here often, and says that they are consistently delicious.  If I was unreasonable, I'd give this place less stars because I'm pissed it's not here. But I'm a reasonable chick, so I'll just go and open my own franchise.

      We chose this place not because of the reviews, but because it was the closest to where we were standing. This restaurant is right at the entrance of the Miracle Mile, right across from Hawaiin Tropics restaurant. Glad we stopped here for lunch - the place is pretty affordable, and if you get a hot sandwich, food is pretty good! I thought I'd be disappointed, but the bread was all buttery and toasty, cheese melted, just in enough mayo. I think I ordered...shoot i forget. Turkey with cranberry? I didn't even end up finishing it because it was so filling!

      It's nice to have a normal food in Vegas (read: neither overpriced buffet with long lines nor restaurants whose a meal would require you to take out a mortgage).    Found this place by accident (after refusing to wait for 30 minutes at Studio Cafe - MGM and boycotting Wolfgang Puck) and couldn't have been more glad.  Apprehensive at first at the "The Best Sandwich On Earth" slogan (or something to the extent), thinking that it might be a gross misrepresentation on their part.  Thank goodness the apprehension was unfounded.  Caribbean Jerk Chicken (I always find myself drawn toward anything that contains jalapeno or chili peppers) and oatmeal raisin cookie (ditto - anything sugary) was fantabulous, price-wise ($5.75) and taste-wise.

      A good solid place to grab a sandwich.  All their sandwiches and salads are $5.95. I tasted the Original Roast Beef sandwich which was warm and gooey, and their cobb salad with chicken, bacon, cubed cheese, and ranch dressing. Both were enjoyable, but the gf said the sandwich was a little on the bland side.  Its nice when you can bring in a 24oz margarita that you bought on the street, sit down and eat a nice hot meal with it, and no one looks at you funny.

      $6 sandwiches in the middle of Planet Hollywood Casino?  Awesome!  We were originally going to eat at Hawaiian Tropics Zone across the hallway until I walked in and saw 6 guys getting served by two waiters.  really, who goes to HTZ to get male waiters.  Anyways, Earl's has great tasting sandwiches at a great price...you'll just have to deal with waiting in line to get your food as its fastfood style.  Not much for ambiance but extremely convenient and palatable.

      have sandwiches been around for 250 years?   sandwiches here are good considering the price. they are pretty fast, but if you arent there when they call your number, they will not call it again. the cupcakes are not worth eating. the ice cream sandwiches were out. i wish i could have tried them.

      I dragged my friends down from the other end of the strip to try out this gem in Planet Hollywood.  We weren't disappointed.  Ordering is very efficient, but since it's packed, the sandwiches take a little while to make.  No complaints though.  I ordered an Earl's Club, which was really good, and a hefty but not too large size to keep me full (photo above).  All sandwiches are only $5.95, and everyone in my group loved theirs.  The bread is really good as is the sauce, meat, and everything else in the sandwiches.  I'd venture to say this was my best meal on this trip, factoring in taste and cost - not bad for a sandwich shop!

      Leave it to me to go to Las Vegas - a Foodie Mecca - and order a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch.  Granted, this sandwich was ordered while suffering from a food hangover from a fancy dinner tthe night before AND 6 am nachos earlier that morning, but work with me here and see me for the rough &amp; tough PB&amp;J (not P &amp; BJ) gal that I be.  $3.95 for a freaking sandwich.  What a bargain!  At the sandwich place by my office in San Francisco, this pretty little focaccia &amp; peanut buttery goodness would have set me back ten big ones.  Instead, I left with almost six dollars to blow on the wheel-of-fortune slot machines that call my name in their sweet, sweet way.  The $3.95 special was off the Kid's Menu, but I batted my eyelashes in an epileptic way that I haven't done since I ran a red light during my driving test and really, really, REALLY needed my license.  Two PB&amp;Js later, Lindsey and I headed up to our room to prepare for another chaotic evening.   Unpretentious + Inexpensive = 4 peanut butter &amp; jelly-filled stars

      Huh.  Not understanding the enthusiasm about this place.  I mean, OK.  It IS fast (counter service only) and cheap (by Vegas terms, anyway).  Sandwiches run about $6.  But they're not that great.  I had Le Frenchy, which is ham, brie, and dijon mustard.  It was OK, but I couldn't even detect the brie on the sandwich, which was the entire reason I ordered it in the first place.  Liz C. had the ultimate grilled cheese, which was supposed to have three different types of cheese on it (and bacon!), and you could barely detect the cheese on *her* sandwich.  The bread everyone is raving about tastes a lot like Schlotzsky's bread to me - which, you know, is fine, just not "special."  I also tried one of their cupcakes with sprinkles and it was kind of gross.  I've made yellow cakes out of a box that tasted better than this thing did.    Considering the culinary mecca that Vegas is supposed to be, I've had limited success at finding really great food here.  The Earl of Sandwich at least succeeds in being reasonably priced, but I can think of several sandwich places at home that could beat the Earl with both hands tied behind their back.

      I might make going to earl a religious thing now when I come to vegas.  If you get a craving for a sandwich, this is the place to go.  I had it again this weekend and it confirmed my previous visit when I remembered it to be really good.  The sandwiches are not overly priced (~$6), and they make for a delicious and refreshing lunch.  Even when the lines are long, it goes really fast because they have a good staff.  The sandwiches are really tasty...the bread they use tastes really well when its toasted.    This is a great option if you don't feel like eating at a buffet or when you want something quick to eat before you hit the road to go home.

      After eating a $13 sandwich at Canter's, I went to Earl to see what the rave about this place was about. Eating at Earl is like shopping at the clearance rack, you still get some great stuff at like half the price.  The sandwiches, although not big were delicious. The bread was perfectly toasted, very spongy and soft like a baby's butt. Everything else was what you would expect in a typical sandwich.  Hot toasted sandwiches rule.

      ok. im going to try to be fair to the earl. after all, it's not his fault that my feet hurt in my heels - which apparently got no traction on the highly-polished miracle mile (where this place is located) floors. it's not his fault that i ate shit -HARD- on the concrete floor, landing all knees and wrists and while walking with my boss no less. i concede that.  it's not earl's fault that the miracle miles has the worst layout of all time, and an even worse "you are here" map, which led to even more risk of slipping and falling again as we wandered forever trying to find that wing it was stashed in. we finally found it and for being a sandwich place i was kind of disappointed. there were maybe 8 options (versus a dilly's which is similar in price and order and pick up at counter style). really, all i wanted was a french dip (or meat on a bun with meat juice, as i affectionately refer to it and order when i am starving). but i settled on a tturkey, tomato and brie and their "signature famous" lemonade. the food took kind of while to finally be ready, and by then i was bruised, starving, pouting that they didn't have a simple sandwich staple and pissed that i finally had to *buy* a $16 pair of flip flops because i really feared i would fall again trying to find the damn place. anyway, it was just ok, and about halfway through the most ear-piercing, loudest fucking siren went off right above our heads. the emergency lights started flashing and the sirens broke - briefly - for a robot voice to inform the stunned and deafened consumers that an alarm had been activated and the reason was being investigated. then back to the sirens! really? it was so loud i couldn't concentrate, let alone eat. we tossed the rest and got the eff out of there. all the disaster aside, the food wasn't good, the lemonade was terrible, and the options were pretty bland -slapping brie on every other sandwich doesn't really make it unique or skyrocket your eatery out of subway level, people.

      For being on the strip, this place is cheap! Especially for the quality of food they have.  The Full Montagu: Good. A little heavy on the mustard sauce, but tasty nonetheless. The Scudetto: My fave so far.  I wouldn't go to Vegas just for a sandwich, but if I'm ever in the area, or if I'm by the one in Socal, I'll probably have to drop by and try their other sandwiches.

      For someone who usually just stays on the strip, it's hard to find decent cheap eats(exception would be that 99 cent hotdog at slots a fun). The price of a sandwich isn't all that bad and the sandwich itself is ok(depends on what you get). I ordered 2 sandwiches, 2 bags of chips and a drink for under 20 bucks. Try finding that in the Bellagio?

      Cheap food inside Planet Hollywood that is not bad. Me and my friend tried different sandwiches and found it to be pretty good and for about 6 bucks you cant get any better.  Sandwiches are run through a toaster like at Quiznos and came out nice and toasty. We ordered the sandwiches by name and liked what came on the sandwishes standard.

      Oh I love the sandwich!  It was suprisingly good.  I wouldn't say it's the best of the world as they advertised, but it's certianly up there.  We went back twice when we were in Vegas, and we had the original sandwich.  The bread is very nicely toasted and just the right amount of crunchness.  The roast beef is really tender and hearty.  Their soups are really good too, especially the chicken chowder.  And lastly, gotta get their fresh fruits, only $1.95 and they are very fresh and tasty.  I would certainly go there again.

      After waking up after a long Friday night of drinking and dancing I was starving the next morning. Located downstairs on the casino level @ Planet Hollywood is a place called Earl of Sandwich which served hand's down the best TUNA MELT I have ever had. It's a freshly made albacore tuna salad and melted swiss cheese on artisan baked bread. It was so good that before I called it a night on Saturday, I picked up another TUNA MELT and ate it in our room. Seriously... I think there was crack in there it was so good.

      It's rare to find a place to eat in a casino that's under $10 pp, and actually tastes pretty good. The sandwiches are actually delicious, filling, and a decent value considering you're on the freaking strip.

      I stumbled across this place by accident. I must admit I did not have high expectations, the food in casinos is usually not that good. I was hungry and in a hurry and this place had a small line that moved quickly. I was in no particular mood that day and ordered at random. My selection was The Full Montagu, a sandwich comprised of roast beef, roast turkey, swiss &amp; sharp cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato &amp; mustard sauce.  The sandwich is served hot and toasty. It was excellent! The combination of meats, cheeses, and sauce was well balanced. The sandwiches here are different and a refreshing change from Quiznos, Togos, or Subway.

      We came to "The Earl" by accident. First we were in another casino, I really can't remember which one and it was past "dinner" time but we hadn't really eaten dinner so we wanted something to eat.  We looked up and saw a sign for a deli type place and it was actually called "Snacks".  We got in line at Snacks and it didn't move for like 5 minutes, which when you're drunk and you want fries that's way too long!  Plus the prices at Snacks were ridic.  So we said screw it, let's go somewhere else.  Somehow we ended up at Planet Hollywood and were looking for somewhere to get food.  That's how we found The Earl.    So we walk up to the counter, I didn't even notice the prices until after I ordered.  Great prices for Vegas!  So I ordered like a grilled cheese type sandwich and my friend ordered a Tuna wrap.  Both were delicious!  I must admit that cheese in my sandwich was probably not a good idea a little later that night BUT that doesn't change the fact that the sandwich was really outstanding!  And Cheap! And Fast!   I'm really even lucky I remember what this place was even called!  Oh Vegas...

      Great sandwich to have when you are just in the mood for some quick grub. It's very filling. Can't beat the price and the location. If you love to people watch just sit facing Hawaiian Tropic.

      This place was good but not great, and also not bad.  I think that equates to three stars.  It is definitely a nice option in the sea of casino food you normally encounter.  I thought the prices were reasonable and the food was dependable.  I was thrilled to see that I could get a Cobb salad and it was pretty good despite being somewhat different from other Cobb salads I've had.  It had no avocado but had cranberries and two types of cheeses which were in chunks in the salad (I actually kinda like the cheesy chunks).  It hit the spot and was good.  My friend had the Cobb salad in a wrap which she also enjoyed.  We were able to order and get food very quickly, and there is a coupon for 10% off in the book you get when you sign up for Planet Hollywood's players' club.  We had no problem finding a table.  The food is served in very handy little carrying bags that you could also take to go to another hotel or back to your room at PH, if so desired.  I would return here if I was nearby.  It's inexpensive and dependable, and it's not a sit-down meal which makes it convenient.  I am not sure I would travel too far to get here but I would go here again if in the area.  I also will add that I should return to actually try a sandwich since that really does seem to be their main thing.

      Located inside of the Planet Hollywood casino/hotel, good place to stop and eat.  Came here in May, so I forget what I ordered, but I remembered it was good enough where I started to crave it after. Wait was a bit long, but tolerable.  I'd come back, and I probably will. MMM!!

      BEST SANDWICH EVER.  Came here on a whim because I couldn't find pink's hot dogs, but I sooo do not regret this decision. Makes me want to get 10 sandwiches next time I'm in Vegas just so I can savor it.   I had the caprese sandwich, and my friends had the hawaiian one with pineapple. While there's was tasty, mine was DELISH. The bread is perfect and toasted, and definitely hit the spot. Makes me drool just thinking about it.......

      Minus one star for putting tomatoes on my sandwich and then for the Einsteins working there who took about 15 minutes to fix it for me.  Once they got my club sandwich right though, it was very good.  I enjoyed the potato salad, too.  My husband's hawaiian bbq sandwich was gobbled right up, too.  Would definitely go back!
