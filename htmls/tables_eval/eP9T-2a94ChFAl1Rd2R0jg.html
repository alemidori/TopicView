      The property itself is stunning with its gold glass and palatial lobby. I loved that it is a non-gaming property though I know some folks will disagree. First and foremost, the service was unbelievably good. From the valet to the bellman to the front desk staff to housekeeping... Every single person seemed to sincerely care about ensuring that our stay was as effortless and pleasurable as possible. The only time I have experience service commensurate with that at the Trump Las Vegas was at the Four Seasons in Manhattan. That is really saying something. The suites are gorgeous and reminded me a lot of the suites at the MGM Signature, another non-gaming property and one of my favorite hotels in Las Vegas. Perfectly appointed mini-kitchens (even in the "studio suite") luxurious bathrooms (two full baths in the "one bedroom suite") and 42" HD televisions which I really do consider a requirement these days. The pool was another highlight, surrounded by endless open chaise lounges and circular, semi-tented padded lounges big enough for two. This hotel is definitely geared towards an older, more affluent and international clientele and it showed. The hotel and staff are both first rate and I look forward to staying there again on a future trip to Las Vegas.

      Well, well..a five-star hotel deserves a five-star yelp rating.  I like the fact that it's a non-smoking hotel. One can only take so much of second-hand smoke. The hotel is not bustling with excitement and that's fine with me..there's enough excitement on the strip anyway.  The decor is classy and glamourous - shades of gold and sparkling diamonds. Wins a girl's heart over! The cabanas in the pool area are perfect. Order a smoothie, lie in the shade, and tan your legs away!   The service = PERFECT. I miss the complimentary Escalade service. No need to ride in taxis with seedy drivers. I miss the doormen who literally RAN to the car to open the doors for us. I miss the chocolates from the maids. The delicious Trump fries. The free sunscreen. Free water.   Best of all, we had 7 girls stay in one suite and Trump management never once complained. Amazing!

      For a five start hotel i was disappointed, better off staying at Wynn or Bellagio.  Pluses:  Rooms very spacious and very nicely decorated  Minuses: - Staff constantly ignored the do not disturb sign, a pet peeve - especially in a 5 star hotel - LOTS of outside noise from rail line.  clearly no double glazing  - Not a lot of hotel amenities - Pool closes at 8 - Too far to walk to the strip, and not a safe walk at night, no lighting and no sidewalk for most of it - very limited room service menu (and a little over priced) - no 24 hr room service (again .. this is meant to be a 5 star hotel)

      Not so fast, Donald Trump - work out the issues before you open your hotels.  - No coffee in the room despite a coffee maker (staff said they'd fix that). - No taxis in front of the hotel, so expect to wait. Apparently, it's an ongoing problem, according to the staff. - Rooms are not insulated well from the outside (both on temperature and noise - a train woke us up early in the morning) - Crummy, simple wading pool.  - Valet takes forever. - DFJ Restaurant is not worth the price - especially not for breakfast.  The good: - Service was very attentive and staff very friendly. - Nice rooms with efficiency kitchen (not that I need that) and really nice bathrooms (a tv embedded in the mirror, jacuzzi tub, giant shower) - Double entry into the room: cuts down on any hallway noise. Very nice. - Clean and quiet hotel. Probably because it's so new. - Location: It's nice to not have to wade through crowds on the casino floor to get to my room.  - Nice ambiance in the lobby with classic jazz in the background. - Mall right across the street so the wives could shop while we took naps :-)  You can do better at the Bellagio, Wynn or even the Venetian.

      I looooved every minute of my stay at the Trump International in Las Vegas.   I checked in on a Friday and was immediately upgraded to a one bedroom suite with a beautiful city view.  Service was over the top.  The front desk folks, valet drivers, all of the staff were nice and gave me world class service!    As a non-smoker this hotel was perfect for me!  And I have to say it was right across from the fashion mall and since I'm a shopaholic this was a huge plus!  I highly recommend this hotel to anyone.  Loved every minute of my stay.

      We stayed here 2 nights.  The rooms were exactly what you'd expect for a 5 star, Trump hotel.  Beautiful, elegant and plush.  The bathroom was FANTASTIC!  The bathtub was soooo big, my husband and I could have fit 1 more person in it with us :-p.  Plus it had jets that had 3 settings.  My hubby also REALLY liked the fact that there was a TV in the mirror, he has requested one in our new home, HA, as if!  Only a couple of minor downsides to the bathroom, the glass doors are super heavy and slam easily if your not careful (I though I was going to break them), and the shower head was too small and not enough pressure.    The robes were AWESOME, super soft &amp; only $125 to purchase, not much more than nice robes @ department stores.  The loss of a star was for the staff.  They were inattentive and short handed.  In my experience, a hotel with a 5 star rating should have the HIGHEST level of service!  I realize that the hotel is newly opened and therefore working out the "kinks" however, this is not Trump's first hotel and therefore the staff should be prepared before opening.  By 3.5 months into operations, you'd think they'd have it worked out.  There was no taxi line and only 1-2 valets who were running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  People were when they got the valet's attention, not who got there first.  The gym was well equipped and we made use of it.  We just walked in &amp; started working out, after a while, a staff person came by to ask if we had signed the waiver before working out, he said when we were done we should sign it &amp; it would also give us full access to the spa facilities.  As we went to sign the waiver, we noticed in small print at the bottom that we would be charged $22 dollars/person.  Since the desk wasn't monitored, we didn't sign &amp; didn't use the spa.  One more thing, the pool is not very big but there are lots of lounges &amp; half canopied daybeds.  The cabanas, however, are not finished and will not be done until next year.  The pool also looked a little dirty, due to the construction I'm guessing.  We booked on Priceline so we got a great deal.  I would definitely stay there again, for the right price.  I forgot to mention that super late at night, we could hear the road noise from the window &amp; we were woken up at 8:30 by the train that honked when it when by.

      I just got back from a two night stay here and it was grand. The only reason it did not get five stars was because its out of the way location on the North end of the strip. The thing I really appreciate about this place is that its a respite from Vegas. There is no casino and smoking in the hotel. At least for me, its nice to come back to a place after a hard night of partying where I can relax and get away from it all.   The rooms are gigantic. I've stayed at many properties on the strip and the standard room is much bigger than anything I've ever been in. The bathroom is equipped with a huge soaking tub and there is even a TV embedded in the mirror so you can be entertained while brushing your teeth.   The room only has one bed, so that could be a problem if its being split amongst a group of friends. There is a sofa that can be converted into a bed for extra sleeping space. There is also a kitchen with a stove and microwave, but personally I can't ever imagine anyone using it. I just can't see people going to the grocery store and getting food, and in the process skipping all the great restaurants in Vegas.   Lastly, if you love shopping, it is right across the Nordstrom at the Fashion Square Mall. I mean, it's a literal one minute walk from the front door. I love shopping, so that definitely was an extra plus.

      This five star rating is based on the accommodations that differ from other 5 star hotels that I have been to.  This was a basic room but it came with stove, blender, toaster and microwave.  The cabinets were stocked with dishes, pots, pans and plates and the drawers had all the silverware necessary.  Not only is there an ice chest but also a cocktail shaker.  My favorite unnecessary item was the salad spinner.  I know these things I've listed are not really anything "cool" but my five start rating is based on the fact that this was a basic room with accommodations for food preparations.  Yes it is Vegas and there are plenty of restaurants but its nice to have options.  You can make yourself a protein shake if you'd like or even a salad with the salad spinner or have it your way and go out to dine.  At least you know that you have an empty fridge that is not filled with snacks that will be charged to your room.  I hate it when u can't store your own stuff in the fridge, but not to worry, there no problems here.  visit kayak.com for deals, rooms are regularly @ $199. I booked at $171 three days in advance to my check-in.

      just based on trying to make a reservation via telephone, i give it one star.   jesus h christ.   trump can afford to stop outsourcing his calls to travelworm. after three attempts, waiting on hold for an hour (collectively) and being told the same thing, agreeing to it then being put on hold, coming back and repeating the same thing, being put on hold then coming back and repeating the same thing... i gave up. they cannot understand you and repeat themselves over and over and over and over and over and over.  and over.

      Nice, quiet hotel located away from the craziness of the strip.  The room reminded me of a (really nice) studio with the kitchen and decor. We had a pretty nice view of the strip and the bathrooms are spacious with a tv in the mirror! Not that I ever used it, or anything in the kitchen, but you gotta appreciate having the option. Service was also wonderful, and when the house car (escalade) is available, they will happily take you wherever you need to go.  Personally, I like to be in the heart of all the action when I go to Vegas so this was not the hotel for me.  I basically only used this hotel after all the fun ended. It's a great place for families or maybe people looking for something a bit more quiet.  And don't expect to get a late check-out, it doesn't exist here.

      [background and mindless chatter] The hotel kind of looks like a single tower Mirage stranded off the strip. The lack of self-parking does define a level of exclusivity above even the best of the on-strip resorts but with the lack of gaming and the awkward access, the place needs as much exclusivity as it can muster.  [first impressions] The valet and doormen were polite and accommodating. The lobby was not grand but minimally decorated and finely appointed.  I waited for easily twenty minutes before being checked in (easily a source for minus 1.5 star). Seriously, I started walking laps around the lobby with my garment bag for exercise and distraction.  [the room] [The rooms were pleasant, not super but still refined enough to exude some luxury. I was impressed by the shared entryway to the rooms. A unique feature in my limited resort-staying experience and definitely something that elevated the sense of luxury.  Local and toll free calls were no charge, which seems petty to note, but also demonstrates a sense of class (who charges money for something that is free in the first place?)  The bathroom was spacious and the in-mirror television was wonderful, even for a non-TV watching individual such as myself.  [Summary] I mostly didn't spend much time in the room. For the most part it was a landing pad and a place to change in-between long bouts of vegas-party-lifestyle and I felt quite accommodated.  It's not faux-style, flashy; it's not trying hard to be part of the strip and with that, the Trump International Tower is a fairly laid-back, luxurious place to arrive and depart, rest your head and recuperate before taking on the vegas scene.

      I was looking forward to staying at a Trump property and I finally had a chance in Vegas!  I have to say that I was a little surprised to learn that there was no casino.  But, I chose to go anyway.  It's Vegas.  It's Trump.  What the hell. So we got to the hotel and the bellman/valets greeted us in usual fashion.  Walk into the lobby, it smells refreshing (unlike all of the stale smoke in other hotels) and we're greeted by yet another person who directs us to the check-in counter.  We check in swiftly and go up to our one bedroom suite.  You know you're in a nice hotel when they have a double entrance to your room!  This greatly keeps out the hallway noise even though there was none because I think the hotel was pretty empty!  But you get my point.   I've been in a lot of nice hotels, but this is one of the nicest.  Fully stocked kitchen with granite counters, Sub Zero frig, Bosch stove, etc.  We didn't use it, but hey, it's nice ok?    Full size dining room table and huge couch and plasma TV in the living room.  Bedroom is pretty large with another plasma and the bathroom is as large as a one bedroom studio apartment!  2 person shower, jacuzzi bathtub, separate room to drop off the boys at the pool, marble everywhere.   Oh yeh, and the TV in the mirror is a nice touch.  There is also another marbled-out full bathroom off of the living room.   Bed was nice and plush and sheets were lux.   It's located one block off the strip, so that's a minus.  If you're walking back from the Wynn or Venetian or somewhere close at night with wads full of cash, take a cab back!  That one block is pretty dark and feels like you're walking into an ambush!  But that's me.  Overall I would definitely stay here again.   5-stars to Donald and Ivanka.

      I booked a room online midweek for a ridiculous rate (shh...but $168 ridiculous low) and for that price it was easily the best room I could have ever gotten. Valet Parking is ridiculously priced and takes a good amount of time to get your car from the multi-leveled garage but as soon as you walk into the hotel you're greeted by luxury.   I definitely pulled a free room upgrade with a $20 between my drivers license and CC so that was even better. The room I had was an exquisite 300sqft gem with super plush sheets, a hot tub with bubbles, martini mixer, refridgerator with mini bar and a full lounge area with flat screen TV. It was exquisite.   The bad news is that theres no casino here though that didn't bother me whatsoever - all the rooms are non smoking - again, not an issue for me - but it is definitely a good distance off the strip and too far to walk to the cool clubs..and cabs are expensive.   I had a breaker go out in my bathroom with the tub and music going but "Engineering" was up within 15minutes to fix the problem. Rooms ervcie was fast and tasty and they didnt mess up my 4pm wakeup call.   Check online for SUPER specials before you book - and enjoy the luxury of Trump.

      I definitely wouldn't recommend this hotel for those on a budget, families, or first-timers.  This is an excellent hotel to come to at 5:30 am after a long night of gambling, boozing, and dancing.  It's quiet since it's a little bit off the strip and has no casino, and it's nonsmoking.  I think I saw like 2 kids the entire weekend.  The service was great and my girls and I got to ride the in-house Escalade to the Wynn b/c we were too lazy to walk.  Oh, and room service...the Trump burger is excellent.  A bit pricey but worth a try.  There is no self-parking, but valet parking isn't too bad just $14/day.  I've stayed at other hotels where valet is $29/day.  Like I said, this hotel isn't for the stingy but if you must, parking is free directly across the street at the Fashion Mall.  Some of my girls didn't have any clubbing gear but since the mall was directly across the street it was quick and convenient to spruce up their wardrobe without traveling across the strip.  The pool is small but I love the little cabanas outside you can bask in.  The rooms and bathrooms are a decent size, but the comfort deserves an A.  The bed was very comfortable.  Now the jacuzzi tub is the star of the weekend...after clubbing for 5 hours straight I appreciated my stay here.  Getting to relax in a bubbly bath with jets blasting at my tingly toes won me over completely.  And the best part is that I pricelined this hotel for $150/night.  Thanks Trump!

      Holy cow. Didn't get to explore the hotel outside of the room, much, but after walking into our suite, we immediately knew we'd regret moving to the Bellagio the next day.   Every finishing touch you can imagine seemed to have been taken care of, and the bed was incredible.   As others have said, priceline search for a 5 star hotel on the strip worked great. Keep in mind: no casino in here, but shuttles and cabs are plentiful, so no biggie.

      THIS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL, LUXURIOUS, PRESTIGIOUS, EXCLUSIVE 5-STAR HOTEL ON THE STRIP  Or so the Donald would have you believe.  Too bad it's not on the Strip.  And I'm really not sure it's 5 stars either.  Curse you Priceline!  I'm not sure how they can say this place is on the Strip when it's actually on Fashion Show drive and a surprisingly long walk to the other casinos.    PROs: -Beautiful rooms  -Wonderfully comfortable bed and linens -Full kitchen -Bar tools (cocktail shakers, martini glasses, leather coasters, etc.) -Beautiful bathrooms with a TV in the mirror -Great bath robes   CONs: -zzzzz.....Boring and quiet -Did I say quiet?  It's NOISY.  You can hear sirens blaring and the damn train whistle all night long. -$13 for parking with no self-park option?  Hells no. -No casino (I thought this would be a positive...it wasn't) -Pool area (nice cabanas, but unfortunately pretty dead)  Bottom Line:  If you're young, looking to have a good time, and/or actually like gambling in Vegas, this isn't the place for you.

      Hands down the best hotel i've ever stayed at.  I give a high five and 5 stars to everything. People at the desk, valet, the room, food, the pool, service in general, everything. I couldn't have spent better money else where.  Just like the rest of the people said, not having a casino is CLUTCH.

      Ran into a long stretch of NOTHING between Wynn and Sahara so I ducked into Trump for some more action! NO CASINO! "Mr. Trump prefers it that way" said the girl at the front desk. "If youd like to visit the bar?" SURE!  Talked with the bartender, Katherine for a bit until I was joined by Karen just a few seats away. Had great conversation about the US and Australia - her home downunder...  She and I had drinks together until she said that she was hoping I would escort her to Wynn for some gaming. Got a cab and off we went! Sat at a great lounge first for a couple glasses of wine and were too messed up to game! I told her, after dropping her back to her hotel that Id like to try again tomorrow...

      When TRUMP comes into mind, I think of over the top, great service, and absolute perfection. I was wrong! I've experienced better. First the Pros - non-smoking, the staff was friendly and courteous, great view of the strip from our room, rooms are setup nicely. Cons- when you walk into the lobby, we checked in around 7:30pm, the live band was blasting away and you can barely hear yourself and your yelling at the front desk clerk while checking in. VERY ANNOYING!! The furniture is dusty, coffee maker is dirty and hasn't been cleaned. When house keeping cleaned the room, they didn't replace the coffee or even refill the kleenex in the bathroom, and had to call to get a refill (had to wait on hold before speaking with someone when calling the front desk). Now if I'm at a hotel all I want is convenience, since this is a service industry, having to deal with slow service is unacceptable. The TRUMP hotel is nice, but they need to polish up. I wouldn't recommend this to my friends unless they don't care about the small details.

      Great hotel, classy but not cheesy at all.  My favorite hotel on the strip.  People complaining that it is "not" on the strip are lazy morons, it's a 4 minute walk to the Wynn!  No casino is perfect, I like to go to hotels to sleep and chill and this hotel is great.  Surprisingly the restaurant was also excellent!  My friend had the steak and I had the sea bass and both were cooked perfectly.  The service throughout the hotel was top notch.  Thanks for putting a hotel in Vegas with smart decor, great food, excellent service and REAL class.

      Two words only. Top shelf. This is a sublimly first class experience.  I say sublime because the level of good taste and sophistication that oozzes from the joint is beyond most people's comprehension.  From the fragrant lobby to the Le Crueset tea kettle in the kitchen no detail is spared.  And it has just the right amount of bling to remind you that are in a Trump hotel and secondly that you are in Sin City.  The staff is exceptionally well trained and again, top shelf. With a level of customer service unsurpassed by Bellagio, Wynn or Palazzo and it shines a bright ligth on how bad customer service is in LA.  They kissed our butts, in a good way though, it was very sincere and friendly.  They made us feel like, well, Donald Trump himself without going over board.  It all just seemed very intimate and natural.  I will say that the gal at the desk in the spa didn't seem to be cut from the same cloth but why are spa desk girls so snotty anyway.? Because she didn't even seem to try to make me feel welcomed, I cancelled my appointment.  We didn't get to try DJT, the house restaurant because it was closed on Monday.    I recommend the suite, just below the penthouse, on the 45th floor.  It's on the corner and you get breathtaking views of the strip from the living room, the bedroom and the spa-tub.  Worth every penny!

      This was a weird hotel experience. The room was very nicely decorated and all but that's pretty much the end of the good stuff. We're told there is a butler service or something like that but it ends at 6pm or something, so we never had any use of that. When we found out at 10pm there was no cork screw in the room, it took the hotel 40 minutes or so to get us one. There is no 24 hour room service. It ends at midnight or so. And the bar closes too at that time. One restaurant, I think, though we never made use of it. The worst part? I'm a professional software developer and I could not get the Internet service to work. For your information, the nearest hotspot that I could find is at the Starbucks in the far end of the Fashion Show mall across the street. So what is the target group of this hotel? Clearly not party people and there is no gambling. Kids would hate it. I think it targets Trump's peers: people over 60 who want to go gamble at Wynn and then get a nice, good sleep in a quiet room in the golden phallos. Oh, the fitness room was pretty nice though, but I think it cost me extra. And yes there was basic kitchen equipment in the room, which was nice but doesn't add any stars. Thankfully I didn't pay a whole lot for the room on Hotwire. Five stars, my foot.

      Wonderful.  With this experience, I left both Vegas and Trump hating them more than before entering them. Entering the city and the the Trump hotel, not the city and the old pig with a comb over, that is.  Got a $159 deal on Hotwire (i.e. not knowing it would be Trump). I was at least expecting Trump in Las Vegas to be as tacky, tasteless and obnoxious as the old fucker is in the rest of the world. Unfortunately, Mr. T. always gets it wrong.   This place is unassuming, uninteresting and doesn't live up to the expectation of a 5-star hotel.  - Ultra minimum staff: 20 minute wait for valet parking, 1 or 2 at the check-in and check-out counters (with a huge line), passive room cleaning service - Clunky bathroom (noisy doors, no waste basket, weird lighting) with minimum amenities - Stained iron board - Extra Wi-Fi charge - Weird bed frame about 20% bigger than the bed (very comfy bed)

      We were booked at the Treasure Island on New Years Eve to be close to the party we were going to at Babareeba. When the trump tower showed up on Hotwire for $100 less than we were paying at TI, I had to jump on it!  Checkin: Because of their stupid no self parking allowed policy, we did have to wait 15+ minutes for valet. This was probably just because of NYE though. Line to check in was fairly long as well.. but no worries, the staff gave us all champagne to sip while we waited, so I consider my 5 minutes in line well spent when I'm given champagne to drink!  Room: We stayed in basically the crappiest room in the place. A studio (vs a 1,2+ bedroom suite), and on almost the lowest floor (floor 18, number starts at 17). Despite this, this room was one of the best I've stayed in in Vegas (and I've stayed in most of them!). The view while non-strip was still good - a side view of the Treasure Island and mountains, etc. The amenities were amazing! Full kitchen (awesome fridge, blender, toaster, Le Creuset kettle), HUGE tub with jets (one of the biggest jet tubs I've had in Vegas), really comfy bed, and gourgues knick-knacks and decor that made the place feel like a million bucks rather than cheesy.   While Trump is an ego maniac (for instance he sells his Vodka for $25 more per bottle than Grey Goose... really Mr Trump, your Vodka is better than Grey Goose?), and I've always been turned off by the gaudy gold exterior.. I have to admit, this guy knows how to do luxury right! I can't complain about one thing.   Look for this place on Hotwire.. under the 5 star category. It's the only 5 star on center strip with a kitchenette (so you'll know it's the Trump!). You can score some killer deals on this place.

      There are certain expectations when I stay at a "so called" 5 star hotel.  Anything short of calling me "Mr. FoodSlut" would be unsatisfactory.    Sure the rooms are beautiful and the bathroom with the TV built into the mirror is awesome, but service is crucial for a 5 star classification.  I really felt like a nagging father telling my son to do shit.  For example, we requested several things (champagne glasses..wine glasses...) MULTIPLE times before it came.  Kiddin me?  Want to pull up your valet from you room...nope, they're lazy asses.  Anyway, don't be fooled by the location.  This isn't actually ON THE STRIP.  BUT, close to STRIP clubs.  If you're into that....  Look elsewhere for a 5 star.

      Mr. Trump, you are a master of the deal.    You described this place as close to the strip.  It was close to the strip CLUBS.    You described this place as five stars.  I could barely get any service after five calls.    Your Italian coffee tasted moldy, your resorts services were subpar and your lobbies smelled like Swisher, the bathroom cleaning service.  Mr. Trump, you pitched me a Lexus and sold me a Toyota!

      I'd have to say that the Trump hotel defied everything I've ever thought about anything "Trump".  When I think Trump,  think over-priced: Nah, hotwire hooked me up for super cheap - $129 for weekend nights in September!  When I think Trump, I think gaudy and hideous: Nope again, clean, modern rooms with GINORMOUS bathrooms, fantastic amenities, comfy beds and some of the most spacious rooms I've ever encountered without spending a zillion dollars in Vegas.  When I think Trump, I think pretentious and snooty: Still no, everyone was courteous, friendly, helpful and polite, from the valets, to check-in clerks, bartenders, to servers.   True, this place is about a block off the strip (across from the mall if that cut-through makes you feel like it's less of a stroll) but still just a stone's throw from the Wynn. With no casino or 24 hour restaurant inside, this place isn't the best suggestion for your bachelor party or college reunion. But if you're like me and often make low-stress trips to Vegas with a specific reason for being in town, this is defintiely my new preference in lodging. Well done Trump, looks like your hair piece isn't the only deceiving thing about your image, and apparently that can sometimes be a good thing.

      For the record, I read all of these review with mixed curiousity when my husband decided to change our hotel from the Luxor to the Trump during our recent trip to Vegas.  The hotel is not on the strip as reported by Priceline.  It is, however, directly in front of a multitude of seedy establishments including strip clubs so I can see the potential for confusion there.  The geographic location of the hotel is a tremendous benefit if you enjoy the frequent sounds of police sirens at any given hour.  Speaking of sounds....let me tell you how my roommates and I laughed at 4:30 AM when the train repeatedly blew it's whistle as it passed into town.  It was obnoxious albeit, hilarious.  This is a daily event.  Beware the 'resort fee'!  As a rule I do not mind paying for things when I know what I am getting.  When I had to sign a piece of paper saying I understood the mandatory $15 per day resort fee, I was told it covered items like my newspaper and valet.  When I mentioned to the gentleman at the desk that I did not need the newspaper, nor did I have a car that would require use of the valet, his response was just, "It's mandatory".  Not only was the fee mandatory, but since I had booked through Priceline, they would not let me cancel my reservation to take my business elsewhere.  I could care less about the $15 per day fee but I know it doesn't cover the newspaper which they advertise as being complimentary and I know it doesn't cover valet parking which I read was $14 per day.  So what the hell is it for?  Internet fee $12 per day.  Seriously!  Even the two complimentary waters we were given did not take away the shock of that cost considering almost everywhere else we went offered free wifi.  The room itself was, for appearances sake, very pleasant.  The king sized bed was very plush and comfortable.  There was no shortage of pillows and the spread was very soft and cozy.  The pull-out couch, however, was a disgrace.  Pity the friend you bring along that gets to sleep on the sofa bed.  The mattress was thin, uncomfortable and unappealing, even after several drinks...ask my roommate!  Despite all of that, the bathroom was luxurious.  I took a shower right after I settled in just to test it out.  I was a little disappointed that I forgot conditioner and decided to use the hotel's conditioner instead.  After all, it was right beside me in the shower.....  It left my hair feeling HORRIBLE!  So I get out of the shower disapoointed again and cross to the sink to use my 'complimentary' lotion.  Weird lotion that my skin did not absorb.  Agghhh, I finally figured out the mystery when I put my contacts in, some fool had put the lotion where the condition was supposed to be and vice versa.  Back into the shower to revive my overly limp hair.  In summation, I loved the room itself.  In the several interactions I had with service staff, servers and tres unobservant security officers, I was not even once impressed.  The drinks were overpriced at the bar and there was no casino.  No shortage of bells and whistles at this hotel however....from trains and police sirens that is.  This will be a do not repeat for me.
