      I had dinner here for the grand opening night. Considering it was the first official day of their opening, service and food was excellent. The waitstaff was friendly and made sure drinks were always full. The burgers themselves are a little smaller than average for a gourmet burger but very delicious. All items are la carte so make sure you order some fries. The truffle parmesan fries are great with their dipping sauces. The highlight of my meal was the strawberry shake with coconut pudding. It's is the most expensive shake I have ordered ($8) but it was also the best shake I have had. The shakes are a must. I would come back again.

      * Since there's no ONLINE MENU - I took pictures for ya'll! Look in the photo gallery. *   The namesake carries some heavy expectations and also prejudices for a TV personality, but this place really has done justice even on just their 2nd day of being opened. I was excited for this as a few days prior I walked by and they were having a meeting. I stood there listening in and looking through the curtain like a total creeper.  I was worried there might be a wait, being a famous name, and brand new. I did try to call, but had a hard time getting to them and decided to come chance it anyways. It was busy, but there was no wait to be seated when we came at 5ish.  The menu is a cheeky paper menu that they encourage you to take as a souvenir, if you wish. With us being a bit of fans, yes, I took mine home. *blush*. Some people might be confused with the two different pricing but the orange is for Total Rewards members of PH Hotel&amp;Casino so before dining, go get a card for a savings of $1 off per each item you order.   The Farm Burger - this was a rather good burger if you like something to showcase natural flavors than big zesty spicy accompaniments. You can tell the meat quality is top notch and the flavor on it is fantastic. We did order a medium rare but it was more on the medium side, just a small oversight. The duck bacon was a curiousity, but basically just like bacon, just less fatty than pork. The brioche bun was so lovely soft and had a perfect flavor and toast to the inside. The egg is always a good flavor with beef. It needed a tad something to tie it all together so put some of the chipotle or curry ketchup on it! It isn't a huge burger, but trust we were full splitting all our items and I can tuck in and eat.   Fresh roasted chili dawg - so the beef "devil dawgs" are cooked in a hellfire hot sauce and then grilled. I would rarely say a hot dog is gourmet or worth paying for, but this was seriously good. Fuck Pinks next door (its not like the one in LA anyways), and get this instead! I love the crispy texas toast like hot dog bun it was on and the dog was snappy, and super juicy and does taste of hotsauce it was cooked in! The toppings of the jalapeno, roasted fresno peppers, avocado, onion, cheddar and chipotle mayo were perfect with it.   Just Fries - these were lovely skin on fries. I read in a press junket they use a specific more fluffy potato and do the 3 step fry method. These were crisp yet fluffy, not thick but not thin either and for me that's the ideal fry. The chipotle and curry ketchups were both very good, I didn't have a favorite. I just alternated every other fry.    Shake # 5 - they split ours up for us which was a nice move on their service. This was rich and so good. I love the texture and flavor contrast between the shake and the swirl of pudding they put. This one was chocolate hazelnut pudding with coffee shake and a awesome praline cookie thin. It didn't taste too much like hazelnuts though, but more like chocolate caramel pudding but still good. It was good to split, it would have been too much for me to do one whole.   Service was super friendly, personable and attentive. Much more cohesive than I would expect of a newbie restaurant. They asked how we heard of them, hows our day going, explained the menu, etc as we sat down and browsed. Our drinks were filled without ever asking and we were checked on a few times to see how we are doing. Their uniforms here are something else. Ladies are very form fitting and short so there's a eyecandy element to this place. After ordering our food did take a while to get to us so we sat around for a bit. Still, I would rather have it cooked right than rushed to where standards are lowered.   Very satisfied with this meal and will be returning absolutely! Of course on principle I do reserve 5 stars for consistency upon return visits, but this is a highly recommended 4 stars. Definitely one of the better burgers I've had in this city and I don't trek onto the strip for bollocks either.

      If you're in Vegas, this place should definitely be on your list to try! If there are any vegetarians in your group, it is also for them. They do have a vegetarian burger that I'm certain is delicious. I went on their grand opening night and was very pleased with their great service. The atmosphere is fun and the food did not disappoint. The servers are very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about everything on the menu which made it difficult to decide what to order since it all sounded so good. My recommendations, if you order the Hell's Kitchen burger, ask for Jalapeños on the side. They are VERY spicy, this way you can at least have the option of putting them in your burger. And if you still have room for dessert, definitely try the strawberry shake with coconut pudding. By far the best tasting dessert I have ever had.

      I was here on Sun and this was their 2nd day (1st lunch opening).  This place was amazing!  It's like an upscale sports bar and since I went on a Sunday, it was perfect for Sunday football!  The openness of the restaurant was very inviting.  I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger and the Roasted Jalapeno Poppers.  The presentation of the poppers was nice and they were in individual shot glasses with their own dip.  It was good especially if you like spicy food like myself.  The only downfall of the burger was that I ordered my burger medium and they cooked it well done.  It was still good so I kept on eating it.  So despite what I wanted, it was still very tasty and I was quite pleased with the manager's attentiveness to the situation.

      We went to this restaurant the 3rd day after their grand opening. Don't waste your time or money.  First we waited 25 minutes to get seated and we were first in line and restaurant was fairly empty.  The staff is super friendly, helpful and great.  The service is extremely slow. From the time they took our order to the moment our food landed on our table was a good 50 minutes. We almost left.  The food is not good. We ordered burgers. They are tiny, the bread is not so good either. Mi ordered a vegetarian burger, which is portobello mushroom, awful. I get the same burger at Cheesecake Factory and it tastes awesome.  The burgers don't come with fried so we had to order fries separately which was $11 per order. 4 burgers and two fries cost us about $120.  I wouldnot go back again. Save your money and go somewhere else.

      Wish I could say we got to try the food...we were sat, and waited for 20 minutes...it wasn't even busy (this is coming from a former server of 11 years who is very sympathetic). We had to leave because I was so hungry and we started to see numerous parties get sat after us. Oh well! The burger that I was going to order came out to the table right next to me (still, we were not acknowledged) and it didn't look great, a little overdone, but who knows maybe they wanted it that way... Next time... Or not

      Really on the 3/4 fence here.  Server, when she was to be found, was very enthusiastic and seemed genuinely excited about her job.  The problem was the execution of her role: asked three times for an ice water, waited 10-15 minutes for a beer, etc.  They were fairly busy and had only been opened three days, so maybe she was still getting acclimated, but I do get tired of making excuses for weak service, whatever the reason is.  The burger I had with bleu cheese was outstanding and the ($8) fries were very good as well.  But perhaps the biggest surprise was how tasty the naan, veggie and sea salt hummus was as an appetizer.  There were three people in our party and the tab, with tip, was $142 and included three alcoholic beverages.  Obscene-even by Strip standards-for a burger joint, but I guess I'd recommend it if you're in the area and don't want to cross the street for the equally good-and not quite as pricey-Holsteins.

      Great food and awesome service. Was only open 2 days back everything was great. This is a must for anyone on the strip. Fun, vibrant and upbeat place. Great selection of food and beer. Will be back again soon. I have never seen such great service. Gordon Ramsey knows how to do it right.

      After popping my Gordon Ramsay cherry I now know what has been missing from my life. One meal at Gordon Ramsay BurGR and I've thought up the greatest restaurant concept of all time: Burgers and Boners.   What is Burgers and Boners you ask? It's a Burger and Wing place where the hostesses and waiters/waitresses are scantily clad. What's that? You think this idea is really similar to Hooters? Well, at Burgers and Boners we will actually serve gourmet food instead of frozen wings and shitty beer.  Where was I? Ah yes, BurGR. The Farm Burger was incredible. It was perfectly cooked, the duck bacon was crispy and flavorful, and the fries came with a curry ketchup that was both confusing and delicious at the same time.  In closing, please do not steal my idea. I will come after you for damages. I know lots of lawyers and you will be sorry. Oh, and don't forget to eat at BurGR. But mainly stay the hell away from Burgers and Boners.

      The food is really good, the service needs a ton of work.  Gordon should bring a crew his TV show that turns around restaurants here to give them some tips.  My dining companions and I shared onion rings, a cheeseburger and a hot dog.  The Hells Kitchen burger was tasty and packed a bit of heat from the peppers. A solid burger that I would order again.  The dog was so huge that it was borderline obscene, also very tasty and packed some heat.  The rings and fries were perfectly good, nothing spectacular.  The service was slllloooooowwwww.  We waited 40 minutes after ordering for the food to arrive.  I am sure the kitchen is slammed and working out the kinks since they've only been open a week but the servers made it worse with comments such as:   "Wow, your food hasn't arrived yet, that's totally sucks!  But I promise it will be worth the wait, save room for dessert"  The comment may have been cute and peppy 1 time but it was gratingly annoying the fifth time.  I'll come back after the kinks have been worked out of the operation.  The burgers are really, really good...

      Dreadful.  Abominable.  Godawful.  "Bad" to the 10th degree.  The meat is tasteless. The buns are stale. The toppings are paltry.  And it's all insanely expensive. I mean come on....$11 for undercooked truffle fries!!!! $16 for a tiny burger with a hard piece of prosciutto on it!!!!  If you want a so-called gourmet burger with unconventional toppings, and a better cut of meat, go to Burger Bar or Barrymore or Holsteins or Bachi. If you want a great regular burger that's infinitely better than this excuse for food, go to Smashburger or Badger Cafe. But whatever you do, avoid this godawful Gordon Ramsey ego fever-dream.  We've all heard that the Brits know nothing about good food. Well, Gordon Ramsey proves it many times over with BurGR.

      This was perhaps the best restaurant burger I've ever had. I typically don't like restaurant burgers as I grew up on overcooked, brick-like burgers so sloppy toppings and juicy burgers just aren't my thing. This however was delicious and I would go again in a heartbeat.   I ordered the uber cheeseburger: burger, 3 cheeses, bun. That's it. Meat and cheese. That is all I need or want in life. Screw vegetables. I also got the Just Fries with the two ketchups. The curry ketchup was interested but I didn't really like it. The chipotle ketchup tasted like normal ketchup so it got the job done.  I really enjoyed the theming/style and the iPad drink menu was neat but a little buggy. I went the second day it was open and it wasn't too busy. Service was insanely good. We must have been helped by 5 different people, each letting us know they were assisting our main server. They each gave us their name and said to not hesitate to grab anyone of them if our main server wasn't available.  I thoroughly enjoyed this place and recommend it highly.

      Burgers are interesting, shakes are divine, parmesan fries are tasty, but the Caesar salad- weaksauce!  It is supposed to have apples, but I discovered only 4 paper-thin slices.  The croutons were greasy and there was almost nothing as far as dressing on the salad.

      Overly ambitious cafeteria style food - with a big name to back it.  Wings were raw, had the texture of something frozen, no juiciness, and awful Asian inspired sauce.   Pork belly bun was just as bad. Dry bun came with the driest piece of pork belly I ever had.  My burger, which is apparently grilled over applewood, had no taste of wood, smoke, or juiciness. The bun was stale and dry.  Why would Gordon Ramsay put his name behind such a place? Clearly he hasn't tried the food.  I lay here after a weekend in Vegas, on the verge of a cold from partying all night at Marquee. I could definitely have used my last meal in Vegas to get some sort of vitamins, or just a little bit of emotional uplift from the food. Instead I left Vegas cold, empty, dejected, and miserable.  Damn you Vegas, and damn you Gordon Ramsay.

      So sad that we had to wait 25 minutes for one of the worst burgers I've had this year.    Bread was rough, dry and just sucked.  Burger was overdone but didn't matter because it was under seasoned and totally not juicy.  I would of taken any fast food joint's burger over this.  Wings tasted boiled, over boiled.  I'm Chinese, cha siu pork baos, yeah nice try.  The server said they buy the baos from a Korean place?  Uh...its a Chinese dish.  The manager took off the appetizers on the bill.  When asked about my burger, he took that off too.  I was like jeeze, I don't need a free lunch.  Just make it good.   Being from San Francisco, we may be a bit snobby but seriously, we know good food, all kinds of food, especially burgers.    5 stars for Garrett our server.  Sorry his great customer service couldn't make the burger taste any better, so 1 star overall.  Many pretty good looking servers including Garrett.

      I'm here to write my peace with BurGr in LV !   My second job is a bartender server as well and I understand about being slammed so when a bartender can make a connection with a customer it's a great thing...service from the lady bartender was excellent albeit quick...customers can feel a servers anxiety and she did well...i was kinda shocked at the gentlemen bar guys telling a customer sitting at the bar (after he waited for his order and requesting where it was ) : 'what do you want bro ?...all our orders are 25 minutes from the grill" Like he was an uninformed goob....come on : the customer was simply asking where his order was...(and it turned out it was ice cream dessert....just pull from the freezer) and don't call him 'bro' cause he ain't your bro...  Asked for a certain temp in the burger and was a few notches North...ugh. Fries...cold and stale...huh ?  Hot Dog...I know there's nitrates in them but damn...! Beer list is awesome...  Too many great burgers all over Vegas to let us down Gordon....  All in all we were politely asked how it was and I never complain but the time I chose to say something...Karma hit me that eve with a touch of food poisoning or my stomach just couldnt keep this down....so to the staff at Burgr yes I understand karma is a bitch and I got mine...so Im here to make peace with BurGr and go on my way....

      It was 3 star for food but great service bumped it up to 4 star! We ordered many different types of food  to try on. The shakes are AMAZING and unique! The 2 shakes that we ordered were: Coconut pudding and strawberry shake, Butterscotch pudding and banana shake. The shakes have a floating pudding on top, creating a different balance of color, texture and taste! Our Truffle parmesan fries came cold and too salty, so we sent it back for a more hot and less salt, and it was perfect. For burgers we had Hell's Kitchen burger (a bit spicy, perfect!), Uber cheese burger (the trio cheese has a unique flavor), and Farm burger, that had egg, oozing out. My favorite was the Hell's burger. We ordered Pork belly Dawg, which was a New York dog (super salty, beware!), with bits of cha siu that was overpowered by the saltiness of the dog, but the bun was a killer. My favorite small dish was Roasted jalapeño poppers that was filled with cheddar cheese, cream cheese and bacon bits,  presented in 6 small shooter glass. Not only it was visually appealing, it also had a bold kick in taste factor! Sticky toffee pudding with vanilla ice cream  was memorable too. I loved the way they put it in a clear pop sickle case that you have to push up to eat it. I know they are just opened a few days ago and there were still things to improve. I will definitely give them a chance again in the future.  I had a nice talk with the friendly manager, Emily, and she was listening and was writing down notes. I liked the fact that they are open minded, and willing to take suggestion to improve. The best part was the SERVICE! They explained the menu and food with passion, very knowledgeable, and very open minded for improvement! Manager Emily ROCKS!!

      Not sure why people are giving this place less than 3-stars =/  Just tried this place out on NYE and it was pretty good in my mind. Although the wait was a bit irritating since we had a party of 6, but not much to blabble about.   Service was great, waitress, hostess, even the manager were all friendly.   Food in my opinion was nothing less-expected from GR.   Ordered the Euro-Burger (Rare) and the Truffle Parmesan Fries.   Both were amazing. Burger was cooked to my order. The fries were dericious, when they were still hot. The 2 sauces (Truffle Aioli &amp; Ketchup) that came with the fries made my taste buds go insane. I especially liked the in-house kitchen ketchup, it had a sweet flavoring to it.   Overall: I would recommend this place for people visiting Vegas to at least try it out.  Will definitely come back and do another review after trying more of their menu!!

      Queue the opening credits from Kitchen Nightmares...  This restaurant appears to be owned by an over zealous TV personality.  The name is quirky as is the location; jammed in-between halls of casino games at Planet Hollywood.  The egotistical pictures slung everywhere from the walls to the opening page of the menus, are sophomoric at best.  The bartenders hurriedly slam Guinness into non-pint glasses, and slop them in front of patrons without care.  The hostesses ask for a phone number so they can text you when your table is ready. Very cool, Gordon but a bit unnecessary.  The iPad drink menus are way less interactive than the ones at GR Steak, and there seems to have been less purchased since we had a to wait a while to see one.  Once seated, the waitresses were clearly over-stressed and undertrained.  The chicken wing appetizer (specifically the wasabi dressing) tasted like a kid fresh from culinary school pretending to understand flavor pairings.  The burgers were next to arrive after a painful forty minute wait.  So this is a BurGR, well it is poorly seasoned and over cooked.  Completely unimaginative and poorly executed.  The milkshake, ordered first, quizzically arrives next and is so sweet it cannot be enjoyed.  Finally, making its way to our table is the order of "Just Fries" and that is exactly what are, nothing memorable or special.    With Gordon Ramsay Steak and Pub and Grill right down the street, one can avoid wasting money here and go experience a location worthy of the Gordon Ramsay name.  Please Gordon, if you read these, go and rescue this nightmare before people begin to associate your name with this mediocre level of restaurant.

      I am a HUGE burger fan.  I mean, I LOVE burgers, love them more than anything in the world.  In fact, I think that my overwhelming love of burgers kind of makes me an expert.  With that said, the burger here was good.  There were JUST a few things that could have been changed to make it GREAT.  I ordered the farm burger, and like the rest of my group, it was cooked just north of medium.  Also, the fried egg that was supposed to "ooze" as I bite into my burger did not ooze.  It really barely squished a bit.  THAT was most disappointing.  Despite the slightly over-cooked patty and the non-oozing fried egg, the burger was good.  If those two things had been on par, it probably would have been freakin delicious.  Along with the burgers, we also ordered the sweet potatoe fries and the garlic parmesan fries, and both were great, but ordinary.  Our server was awesome.  She was nice and super knowledgable about the menu and happily answered each and every question we had with extreme detail.    Oh yes, and the last thing I want to mention is that our food took a really long time to come out, at least 40 minutes.  I wanted to LOVE this place because I'm a huge Gordon Ramsay fan, but I would say that with the amazing burgers all over Vegas, sadly I probably will never return.

      Excellent food!  Still not my fav burger in town, but a top 3 for sure.  Read on!    Started off with the jalapeno poppers....very very good!  But NOT very spicy....I couldn't tell which one had the seeds.  Still the best poppers we have had!  Went with the chicken sliders app for my baby.  I asked for the sirracha mayo on the side, but it wasn't very spicy either.  Baby enjoyed it and ate it up like ketchup!  LOL.  Chicken was probably dark meat, but had lots of flavor and the greens on there were great!  On to the burgers!  Went with the Farm and the Hell's Kitchen burger.  Farm was great, tons of flavor.  The burger meat was cooked perfectly, however, I think they use a leaner beef, since my burger was a perfect medium rare, but not a drip of juice/fat hit the plate.  Still very juicy insides, and good throughout, just not my favorite overall burger in Vegas.  The HK burger was the same way, also very good, NOT spicy at all, but good nonetheless.  Bread was amazing though!  READ THIS :  PARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIES.  This is my most favorite way to consume fried potatoes cut into slivers of goodness.  These BLOW away Bachi's in case you are wondering...they aren't even in the same category.  These are AMAZING and I will come back for the fries alone.  The portion is large as well....plenty for two to share.  There is so much flavor and sweetness/saltiness that is going on, explosions of flavor in each bite.  I will come back here for the fries alone.   Lastly, went with the strawberry coconut pudding shake.  Super super good. The pudding is the winner here...makes me wonder if I can ask for a coconut pudding shake next time lol.  As far as service goes, another 5 stars.  Everytime you need more ice water, they bring a new cup.  One of the bussers took a napkin to our table to clean up all the little tidbits from the fries before dessert arrived.  Service was pretty fast (except dessert taking a while) and we had multiple people checking on our food and experience afterwards....seems like they genuinely care that it went well.  Prices are expected but not abusive.  Atmosphere is super trendy but kid friendly.  Music isn't ridiculous like some of Cosmo's spots....solid choice esp if you are in the PH area!  Go go go!

      we visited this place for the 1st time.  I can only say that we thoroughly enjoyed our visit.  The burgers were the best we have ever tasted.  I ordered the Britannia Burger and others in my part ordered the American.  We also ordered onion rings and the parmesan fries.  They all were the best we have had anywhere.  The service was great as the waiters and waitresses were energetic, personable and very attentive.  This is a great stop for an enjoyable dinner.  I strongly recommend it !!!

      A burger is a burger is a  burger, and I'll always be hard pressed to believe that any burger joint can offer a "fine dining" experience. Gordon Ramsay BurGR understands this, and while a meal there is not "fine dining", it is most definitely "fun dining".  I've visited twice already. Once to sample the burgers and then a second time, because the crazy list of appetizers and sweet treats on the menu caught my eye and lulled me to come back sooner than later. Both visits were a hit.  The menu  is clean and simple and offers eight burgers and three "dawgs" as mains. There are also three burgers that come "stacked" with a meat patty and a meaty extra like shaved prosciutto or duck bacon.   I had the delicious Char Siu Burger served with a beef patty and a slice of roasted pork belly, cucumber, radish, cilantro and a honey-hoisin sauce. The Asian-inspired extras were a nice touch, but the star was the medium rare beef patty that was succulent and juicy, and one of the best burgers I have had on the strip.  The missus ordered the Fresh Roasted Chili Dawg that was smothered with roasted fresno peppers, jalapenos, and a touch of chipotle ketchup. This was also a smash and was so much better than the hot dogs served next door at Pinks.  On our second trip in almost as many days we tackled the "snacks" section of the menu and tried three of the six appetizers.   The Fury Chicken Wings play off the Hell's Kitchen theme that is somewhat overly branded here, with flame decals popping up everywhere. The wings are served eight to a plate -- four tangy hot Buffalo style wings that again proved to be superior to most pub wings I have had, and four honey wasabi wings that provided a different flavor profile and fondly reminded me of the Shanghai Wings once served at a now defunct restaurant in Montreal that was my go-to spot for wings and things.  We also indulged in the four Five Spice Chicken Sliders that were breaded with Cornflakes and were kind of like yummy mini schnitzels in a bun. And while the spices and siracha mayo gave them some kick, I felt they did not need the cheddar cheese melted underneath. That said, I would love to see a BIGGER version of this burger added to the mains.  The Honey-Pig Bao Buns were just OK, and this was really the only miss on our second evening simply because we have had better elsewhere. While I liked the addition of pork belly on my burger, it was a bit too much of a good thing and slightly tough on its own, but that did not stop us from finishing it.  The menu also features two specialty fries that we tried on different nights. I preferred the Truffle Parmesan Fries that were crunchy and doused with liberal amounts of shredded parmesan, while the missus liked the Sweet Potato Fries that included a honey jalapeno mayo and vanilla powdered sugar as a condiment. This will definitely be a problem on a future visit as each portion is more than enough for two, so I hope they add a sampler of some kind to the menu that lets guests indulge in both styles.  Speaking of two people, I have to give props to the our two servers (both named Alex) who made some wonderful suggestions after listening to our tastes, and made us feel so incredibly welcome. We cut past the 30-minute wait on both nights by opting to sit at the back counter that offers an open view of the kitchen, and is where both Alexi (my pluralization of Alex) can be found dashing back and forth as they place orders and pick up plates. Yet not matter how busy they were in that very controlled kitchen chaos, they always popped past us to chat for a couple of seconds, check up with us, and almost made it feel like were were attending a very busy dinner party at a friend's place. What's more, while Alex 2 was our principle server on our second night, Alex 1 acknowledged our return visit and engaged us in conversation while Alex 2 was away working the front of the house.   They also introduced us to Benji, BurGR's evil genius of all things beer, who made some great suggestions and introduced us to the wonderful apricot flavors of Magic Hat #9 after carefully consider of our tastes in ales and Belgian beers.         I also managed to down one of the five "sugar fix" shakes with my appetizers. I opted for Shake #5 following Alex 2's suggestion that its Nutella like composition of chocolate hazelnut pudding and some coffee ice cream had to be tasted to be believed. Oh so decadent! I believe!  Nothing completes a meal like a great dessert and the über fun Sticky Toffee Pudding Push Up Pops, served to us with a smattering of Alex 2's nostalgic impersonation of Bill Cosby shilling for Jell-O and arguing with wife Camille, were simply to die for.   We took these babies to go and I felt like I was in Lord of the Rings. These pops mesmerized all those who saw them. "That looks so so good," strangers said hoping to covet them, but there was NO WAY we were going to share this pretty precious delicious dessert. MY precious pudding push up pops!

      Went here for lunch and had their mexican burger.  The burger was ok, nothing special.  I feel they could do more as far as flavor and seasoning. They have a decent beer list.  The location is cool and great for people watching.  I'd go back but prob try some other places first.

      Visited January fourth for a late lunch. The hostesses were incredibly nice and seated us immediately. Our server Alex was quite friendly and talkative and explained the menu well and answered all our questions. Drinks were great and the onion ring batter DID NOT fall off when you bit into them which is a deal breaker for me. They were crisp and delicious. My daughter had the Hell's Kitchen Burger and I had the Fresno Chili dog. Now the hamburger was good, but the hotdog was fabulous. I could go for one right now! The burger was a little overcooked, she asked for medium rare and it was definitely medium.  The manager Derek came over to check on us and I was shocked at his sincerity and kindness. You just don't see that much in Vegas and it was really appreciated. He will make this restaurant work. Liked the servers outfits, the men's jeans had flames on the back pockets. It was a great experience. went into the pub, but I didn't like what I saw on people's plates. Just personal preference.  Having said that, we went to Gordon Ramsey Steak to look at the dinner menu and inquire about possible dinner reservations (this was January 3rd) and the three dinner hostesses (who should really be called out on this by management) would not give us the time of day! It was my daughter's 21st birthday and we are both fans of the show. We were dressed more than appropriately to inquire about reservations.  One actually snickered at us and they just turned around after shortly saying, we are booked and went into the restaurant. What about the next day girly???? I should have asked for the manager, but I already knew they would never see a dime of mine. So we went elsewhere and had a great time.

      BurGR is located in the heart of the Planet Hollywood casino; one of the worst places for a local to access next to maybe anything inside of Caesar's Palace in my book. You have to travel through a full side of the shops and the casino to get to the restaurant which is adjacent to one of the entries off the Strip. Since it had been open barely a week, and also the weekend right before New Year's, I figured it might be best to make a reservation and called the number on their website. After 4 failed phone calls to either clueless Caesar's employees not knowing that this new restaurant existed, or being transferred to lines that went to defunct voicemail boxes, I gave up and took a chance walking in. We arrived to a 35+ minute wait for two, with plenty of larger groups waiting at the front. Luckily there was absolutely no one sitting at the bar so we took our chances there. The entry has a pretty large fire feature wall, which at the time of my visit still wasn't functioning. There is a fairly plain bar that seats about 15 right at the front, with a very open almost cafeteria-like layout of booths and tables. A pretty cool wavy ceiling swoops through most of the space, only broken up by a flat ceiling centered in front of the display kitchen.  The menu is fairly simple, and really focuses on the restaurant's namesake: burgers. There are a few interesting sounding appetizers, salads and some tasty shakes from what I've heard. According to their website the burgers are cooked over an open flame fueled by hard woods, the only burger joint of its kind on the Strip. More about that in a second. What is nice to see is that the menu does offer I believe 11 different kinds of pre-designed burger options; I've been to far too many celebrity burger joints on the Strip and found maybe 3 choices on their menu. With this many choices, unless the burger was going to be completely awful I figured I'd have to come back and try one of their more adventurous double stacked burgers that come with a regular patty in addition to another kind of meat.   So with this round I went with the slightly more neutral chanterelle burger: chanterelle mushrooms, arugula and figgy-onion jam. What arrived was a perfectly formed burger on an equal sized, perfectly proportioned bun. For some reason I really wanted to hate this meal coming into it, but I was fairly impressed with it upon first bite; the meat was very good quality, and had really good char flavor around the edges that actually made us think back to our last savored bites of a Bachi burger. But that wood-fueled flavor? Not sure that was it. It was cooked close to the medium rare I had ordered, with some pink throughout but really lacking any sort of juices. The chanterelle mushrooms had really good flavor and were proportioned well, and the arugula was a good touch. I forgot all about the figgy-onion jam until after I had finished the burger; apparently either they did too or it just wasn't flavorful enough to stand out. Although the bun was sized perfectly, I found it to be very dry and inconsistent, with some overly buttery bites showing up at welcomed moments. Overall it was a very solid burger. My girlfriend actually compared its overall level of perfection in composition and flavor to the consistency of Bachi, which I understand but don't completely agree with. While I did find the meat to be pretty savory, it's just not on the same level. And Bachi's buns? Forget it; the BurGR ones don't come close.  What was a huge letdown for this meal was how awful the fries were; thin, hollow and completely overcooked. We went with the plain fries over the truffle parmesan or sweet potato in order to sample the basics of what are offered, and maybe that was a mistake. Both the curry and chipotle ketchups that accompany the regular fries are good, maybe the chipotle not as much, but neither flavors really go together or make sense with the burgers we ordered. And they were literally so hard and overcooked that my jaw was almost sore from eating them. Having the perfect fries may have changed my overall perception of this meal a bit, as this is a major gripe of mine.  I think $16 for just the burger is also a little high, even being in a Strip location. If one is to truly compare the composed perfection to a Bachi burger, which I feel there is just no comparison to that burger, you can get far more for $9. And $8 for our plain fries is insanely high; I'm not sure I would ever consider spending $11 for their truffle parmesan or $9 for the sweet potato fries after sampling these. If you're obsessed with Ramsay, or the whole celebrity chef thing, then you'll probably be impressed with the quality of this burger, as many folks on Yelp seem to be right now. But if you're looking for simply a fantastic burger, there are far better options on the Strip in better locations, and plenty more throughout the city for a far better price.

      Sunday lunch, lots of TVs to watch the Football games.  It was opening weekend so you could tell everyone was a bit frantic but honestly service was fine.  Had the Euro burger with goat cheese and it was cooked to a nice medium.  The burger was a nice size, not too big but maybe slightly too small to share.  The truffle Parmesan fries were really good and a pretty large portion (easily share).  The sticky toffee pops were not my favorite.  I order the sticky toffee dessert at all of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants (including one in London) and honestly this version I just wasn't too keen on.  The peanut butter ice cream was the problem.  It seemed too salty, maybe with a caramel ice cream it would be better.  Overall not my favorite burger joint in Vegas (Bachi burger is the current winner) but if I was stuck on the strip I certainly wouldn't complain.

      Usually a tradition once we roll into Vegas is to check in, drop off our luggage up in the room, and hit a burger joint. And being that we were pretty disappointed in our last burger place experience, I am happy to report that Gordon did not let us down! The number one factor was the caliber of the service. Friendly, attentive, knowledgable- 5 stars just for that! Most of my stars are for service and work their way down from the 5 eligible. Food... I take my chances on! It's Vegas after all!  But the FOOD was GREAT. Started with the Fury Chicken Wings. While the 4 Tangy HellFire Blue Cheese Wings were delicious and honestly loved the buffalo sauce, I found the Wasabi- Honey Wings a little bland... even for wasabi. Those 4 wings also had that look like they had been sitting out with the sauce on them for some time. You know when sauces cool and they begin to get that layer that changes texture.. well...oh well.  The Euro Burger was AWESOME! I ordered it medium and the meat was nice and tender! The bun was warm and toasted. The combination of the goat cheese, oven roasted tomato, arugula, and the aioli made for a rich, creamy addition to the beef.  The fries were good, not spectacular. Probably not even great. But good. I ordered the Truffle Parmesan Fries with Truffle Aioli. Maybe if they were like 25% less in price they would have been better.   Im also giving BURGR 5 stars because Im not certain why it already has some negative reviews. Not that Im attempting to bump it up in the ranks, because I know I wont have that effect. But jeeez, some people REALLY complain. I mean how do you come across a dry bun that crumbles? Or dry meat?   Thinking back Im upset I didnt snap any pics of my burger! Or they cool plates and decor. At least they send you off with your menu as a souvenir. =)  Me. Love. GR.

      BURGR was awesome, I ate their 3 times in my recent trip to Vegas, I had great food, in a great atmosphere, didn't have to wait (i ate at the counter by the chefs) and everyone was great, my waiters Alex with the glasses (twice) and Kevin (once) were great, gave me great suggestions on what to order, where super informative about the menu and their service was great, Talked to the GM Darren, very friendly guy, real personable, even gave me a business card to call him and let him know when I was going to be their next, (that's some Vegas treatment), The Manager was Benji, who I had met before being I am a frequent guest at Planet Hollywood "the casino with the best vibe of any casino in Vegas" he came up to me, asked how i was doing and was very nice as he usually is, he generally wanted to make sure I was being taking care of, which i was, All of the Chef's are awesome and they make sure that everything is perfect and in a relaxed atmosphere, the cooks, preps and everyone else is top notch and very friendly, you can tell they really want to give you the best product that they can, Chef's Mickle, Peter, Robert, Vaughn, Luke, Michael, run a nice tight ship, but its also a fun ship, I was in the Club/Restaurant business for 32 years so I made a point to talk to the Chef's and give my compliments on a job well done and they even gave me suggestions on food too, which was great, the food was great, every different type i tried was awesome, I actually took home my own menu and checked off everything i have tried so far, so when I go back in a couple of weeks I can get other items. Another thing that was nice was Alex actually remembered my full name after one visit, (bonus points), even waiter's and waitress's that had nothing to do with me where asking if i needed anything, another good point, I could tell you what food was my favorite, but so far it all as been amazing (I'm also a professional speed eater, so I'm a huge foodie, if their was something I didn't like I'm not shy about letting you know about it, food's one of my hobbies) but the pudding shakes for dessert are a must, Anyway, that's my professional opinion, I will be back their in 2 weeks when I go back to Vegas and since 99% of the time I stay at Planet Hollywood, I'm sure I will be back their a lot more (I kinda want to be the first to complete the entire menu, lol) - If I could have gave them 10 stars I would have, just pretend I did - David Cagle
