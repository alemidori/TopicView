      If anyone gives this less than five stars, you better have a really good reason.  Came here with a large group, roughly 11 people. Tapas is difficult with more than 3 of 4 people, but Julian Serrano's staff made it work.  The cocktails are out of this world. Most of the specialty cocktails are $14; I had a gin and apple liquor mix, along with the red sangria, white sangria. Gorgeous.  The wait staff made recommendations for the large group, nobody left hungry, everything looked unbelievably good. I had eaten beforehand - didn't know I was joining for dinner - but I tried a couple of things. The things I tasted were unreal delicious, the prices were fair. I think we spent $1050 for 11 people, including drinks and gratuity.  The group I went with - major foodies - all left extremely happy, full, and raving about it. I left drunk, just as happy, and can't wait to go back. Julian Serrano himself - the namesake of the restaurant - was sauntering around the place all night making sure everybody was taken care of.  Top class, top taste, reasonable prices. Five stars.

      Tapas, oh how I love you. Julian Serrano is the best Tapas restaurant in Las Vegas and easily the best tapas I've ever had. Located inside the Aria hotel, its location is near the lobby and just has a half wall separating you from the hordes of people gawking at the beautifully decorated restaurant. This really wasn't detracting, but be prepared for a few flash bulbs in your general direction. It really isn't all that noisy, though, considering its location.   Our waiter was great and made our experience perfect. I highly recommend the shrimp cheviche. It's well balanced and the fattiness of the avocado is perfect with the citrus-y shrimp. The plain sounded "Beef and Cheese" was a favorite of ours- tender as butter beef tenderloin slathered in beef demi glaise and walnuts with melted brie over toast. Wow. It was perfection. Each dish we sampled was beautiful to the eye and delicious. Our waiter recommended 3-4 dishes a piece which was just right. We had 6 tapas plates and 3 drinks which set us back $102 before tip. Well worth it.   I tried both sangrias- the red is definitely better than the white which too watery for me.   I plan to go back for more next time I'm in Las Vegas.

      The best meal of my life was at Picasso (Julian Serrano's fine dining establishment at the Bellagio), so I had very high expectations for his restaurant at Aria. I was pleasantly surprised to see him offering a tapas menu here, which makes his cuisine more affordable, in a casual space that opens onto the main lobby area.  Where the food was concerned, Serrano lived up to all my expectations. Four of us shared four dishes as a light lunch - the chicken croquetas, wild mushroom risotto, ahi tuna tempura, and fried calamari - and all were terrific. I just love love love tapas, being able to try a little bit of a lot of dishes, and Serrano's are some of the best I've had (next to Jose Andres's dishes at The Bazaar, in LA). Service was a bit spotty, but I'll cut them some slack since it was only day 4. I'm thrilled to see Chef Serrano offering his immense talent in a more casual, moderately-priced restaurant. It's no Picasso, but for being the "next best thing," it's pretty darn wonderful.

      I have MULTIPLE reasons why this place deserves waaay less than 5 stars.    I wanted to check out the new City Center, so on our way out of Vegas we head over- holy moly, this place is huge!  As we're walking around and trying desperately to find a place to eat, I spot Julian Serrano.  Tapas?  Yum!  So we try it out... (one of my many bad decisions in Vegas...)  It was around 12-1ish (lunchtime), and there weren't too many people seated, but they gave us a table front and center of the entrance.  Not a problem, but that table was rockier than a mountainside!  I told the hostess about the problem, and she quickly alerted the manager, and he came to fix it... with paper... while we were just sitting there.  After a minute or so to no avail, I exasperatingly asked if we could just be moved.  Geez, no brainer, people!!!!!!  NEXT PROBLEM!  Our waitress was slower than molasses.  Took forever to order, forever to get our drinks, her attention, etc... it was a nightmare (maybe her first stint at waitressing? Her shaky hands couldn't even fill our waters without spillage all over the table)!    Since the area was open space, and it's right next to the entrance/exit to the mall (or maybe the A/C was on waaay too high), but it was FREEZING, which quickly rendered our food cold.  I was a Marisa-sicle and just wanted to get the heck out of there.  Only brightside was that the food was good, but def not worth all of the issues.  By the time I finally found our waitress and asked for our bill (and waited foreverrrrrrr for her to get it to us), we find that she billed us incorrectly.  FOREVER minutes later, her manager finally hands us our corrected bill.  By the end of our lunch I was completely unhappy and cold.  SADFACE.

      Tapas eating is just the way to go when you want to dry different plates... We had: *Brava Potatoes - We would have it again. *Flat iron steak - We would have this again. *15 year old Serrano ham - Nice touch with the toasted bread with the ham. *Shrimp ceviche - Ceviche is always good. *Mixed Paella - Good, but wished there was more crust/crunch to the top of it. *Flan - Delish with a strawberry topping. *Spanish creme brulee - Wish I had the flan instead. *White Sangria - Non-stop.  Vegas has so many good restaurants.  Perfect place for Christmas because nothing is ever closed.

      I make around 4-5 trips to Vegas a year from LA. I have been to many of Las Vegas' newest and finest. This establishment falls very short.  After placing our drink order, our first waiter disappeared. The staff finally caught on, and our "new" waiter stepped in to finally take our order. To our surprise, this young waiter condescendingly insisted on explaining to us how tapas works so we "don't have any questions later."  Allow me to stress how underwhelming the food was once it finally arrived. What's even more laughable is the one dish the staff recommended was by far the most mediocre (lobster on a skewer that was overpowered by a slice of pineapple).   When it came to dessert, we came to a decision quite quickly. Once again, ignored by the staff for nearly 20 minutes we opted to take the check. When it comes to tapas, Julian Serrano was one of the most disappointing experiences I've ever had. The absurdly rude and neglectful staff made this experience completely inexcusable.

      Went here with yelper Evan T so this review might seem redundant, but seriously WTF? Yes, this place had been open for a mere week before we choose it as our dining destination, but if your gonna open up in Vegas, you better have your shit together. There are tons of casinos/hotels/restaurants doing things the right way, just copy and paste. JS failed to do that. Three hungry dudes and tapas should have been a perfect match right? Wrong. The food was extremely forgettable, with the worst item being the one recommended to us by our server, the overcooked lobster with canned pineapple skewer. As unmemorable as the food was, the service is not something I will forget. I am convinced we either never saw our waiter or he wasnt working that night, as the gentleman who we kept having to flag down was gracious enough to take our orders but had to keep reminding us that he was not our waiter.  20 minutes after being presented with dessert menus someone returned to ask us what we would like. "20 minutes ago we wanted dessert, now we just want the check." Perhaps this place will work out the kinks over time, but ill let you figure that out since plan never to return.

      Oh Boo Hoo eating well in Las Vegas is expensive. Once you get over the sticker shock at every nice restaurant on the Strip it's time to start eating!  On our first night a friend of mine who lives in Vegas wanted to show us Aria since it just opened last week. Visually, Aria has, in my opinion, the most beautiful casino on the strip. And inside Aria is where Julian Serrano is.  First off I love the decor and the chairs, which look 70s modern are really comfortable. Usually I'm more of a plain chair to eat dude, but these were something special.  I looked at the beer list at the back of the wine list and also a beer list on the main menu and they were different. Very strange. They didn't have Weihenstephaner like one menu indicated, but Fat Tire was fine. You'll find FT everywhere in Vegas.  The food:  ~Dates with almond centers: Good. Weird spicy red sauce to go with them actually melded well with the dates.  ~Chicken croquetas: Loved these. Not sure what part was chicken but they were creamy crispy goddesses i'd eat way more of.  ~Seared scallops with a peanut sauce: $12 for one scallop. Ouch. But!, it was really awesome. Barely cooked. Some people might not like that but I did. Probably would pass next time because of the high price and small size.  ~Flat Calamari (not fried): The most interesting thing I ate in Vegas! I love calamari, but have never had this part of the squid. There were little baby one which you'll see most places, but then they had what look liked the ends of the tentacles. Not sure what part it was but they were fantastic! A must get for the adventurous eater!  This was my 2nd favorite meal in Vegas. I definitely recommend it. Go with a lot of people to try everything on the menu.

      We only sat at the bar and had a couple plates before going to see a show, but I was really pleased with the experience.  The bartender was very friendly and attentive.  He was very knowledgeable about tequila. The white sangria was delicious and fruity without being overly sweet.  The pan con manchego was absolutely perfect - great country bread, just the right amount of garlic and tomato, and very high quality manchego and olive oil. It was very satisfying.    The bartender recommended the wrinkled potatoes, which were deliciously salty boiled new potatoes with a delightful spicy dipping sauce.  The sauce was very flavourful and had the right amount of kick.  Prices were very reasonable and portions were adequate, given that its a tapas place.  Please run around $6-$8 for the lighter fare, and paella closer to $15 (I think) . Tons of great veggie options, which is rare in Vegas.  I'll definitely go back for a full meal in the future.

      I'd love to attribute the awful service to the fact that the restaurant had only been open 10 days, but some things are just inexcusable. We experienced the unfortunate combination of a condescending (yes, I know what tapas-style means for the third time) and nonexistent waitstaff. One guy was trying to cover for the fact the our assigned waiter was a total flake, but the whole place seemed to be flustered and did not seem to care about the 3 young dudes with Yelp accounts that were actually excited to eat this meal. Maybe we weren't gonna drop a large amount of dough on multiple rounds of cocktails, or order the overpriced paellas that I witnessed them misplace on multiple other tables, but please show us the same respect and attention you gave these other Las Vegas tourists. Well you didn't and I came away remembering a lot less about the food than I would've, which is a damn shame because I am pretty sure I ate some pretty good stuff while I was there. For a hotel that has multiple fine dining options, go somewhere else where you can hopefully find service that is up to par with the food and price.

      First of all, Julian Serrano is one of the best chefs in the world - period.  You probably haven't had the pleasure of eating at Picasso at the Bellagio because it's so expensive (and worth every penny), but now you can enjoy the chef's great taste at less of a price at his new namesake restaurant at Aria.  You can tell that each one of the tapas and paella dishes are made with care and each morsel is delicious.  My family and I went for a taste and we couldn't stop ordering!  The sangria is great, too, but watch out - it can hit you.  The restaurant is also beautiful with glass pieces on the floor to ceiling shelves, gold detailing and rich colors.  Stay for a bite or stay for a while - you're sure to have a great time.

      Being the food-crazed person that I am, I perused the menu extensively before making reservations for my husband and I for NYE. We even half way picked out what we were going to have before arriving (yup, I'm food obsessed). I was beyond psyched to try the lobster/pineapple and ahi tuna/raspberry.   Drink orders were taken after 20 minutes. Drink orders were forgotten. Service was pretty damn bad in general. Also I did experience the issue the other person faced where they kept asking about dessert after 10 minutes with our first course (WTF)? These things I can forgive them for, given it's a new place.   The guy finally takes our food order, and after taking the order says "well we're out of lobster, tuna, and scallops". WTF. It's 5:30, we're literally one of the first diners of the evening. He doesn't offer an explanation (mb the supplier flaked?), or an apology. Just "we're out of half the menu" essentially. I'm more than a little irritated, as these were the items I was most excited about.   Why 3 stars? The food we did try was really good.   *Risotto with mushrooms and manchego: Tiny (it's tapas), but DAMN Good. I was scraping the plate.  *Beef with brie: Note, this has honey and nuts all over it. I found it scrumptious, but mb the idea of a honey covered steak doesn't appeal to everyone! *Mini Chorizo over garlic potatoes: yup as good as it sounds *Garlic shrimp: Boring. This was a sad substitute for my lobster I wanted.. grrr *Spanish creme brulee - HUGE and quite good *White Sangria - packs a punch.. there might be 2 hours of NYE that I can't remember and I blame this sangria!  Overall it has major potential, but my first dinner here was a bit of a disappointment. I'm excited we have a high-end tapas place finally, so I'll definitely be back to give it another shot but I'll probably give them a few months to get the kinks worked out.

      The only other restaurant in the Aria Casino that opens for lunch besides their cafe and buffet place. Julian Serrano serves great tapas items. And with Tapas, each dish is smaller but cheaper, anywhere from $8-$20 per plate. If you are not that hungry or usually don't eat too much, you can spend $30 and be quite full.  Recommended dish: flat iron steak (super tasty and moist), dates stuffed with goat cheese wrapped in bacon (4 pieces per serving), fried calamari (great aioli sauce), and to indulge, order the mix paela (comes with a whole lobster) for $45. The menu says it is for 2 people, but  should be enough for 4 people unless that is the only dish you ordered.

      Serrano is an excellent choice in Vegas.  I would even pay more for it given the quality of the food.  My boyfriend and I liked it so much that after eating dinner there, we ate lunch there the next day.  There are not many nice lunch options in the Aria and therefore lunch is definitely more packed than dinner.  For better or for worse, Serrano is near the entrance of Aria and therefore in a busy section. Food comes over quickly so if you need to get to a show quickly or get your gambling on Serrano is a good bet. Service was friendly and efficient. Sangria was decent, but the real star is the great food. In general, I liked the traditional tapas more than the new tapas. We particularly liked: Stuffed peppers with goat cheese: Ok this is the real reason we came back again. A must try. Just perfect. Chicken croquetas: These were excellent. Crispy on the outside and creamy inside. Melts in your mouth delicious.  Dates with almond: Good stuff. Comes with bacon and spicy sauce. But really everything with dates is good. Tuna Tiradito-smooth like butter Octopus: Nice texture and flavoring. Large portion for tapas. Wrinkled potatoes: Simple, but addictive with great spicy pepper sauce. Beef with brie: Good, but not the best thing on menu.  Garlic shrimp: Comes to the table sizzling. Very good, but I've been spoiled by some places in NY. Avocado and salmon "new" tapas: nice texture and presentation. Lobster/pineapple skewer: Surprisingly good combo. Ahi Tuna/raspberry skewer: I like this, but the beautiful raspberries overpower the tuna. Crema catalana -Huge portion. I thought it was for 2 people. Spanish version of creme brulee, but better with more zest.  Pricing here is quite reasonable...which means you can go there twice!

      Went there on 1/8/09 for lunch. I thought I was in for a big surprise and what it turned out to be was a big nightmare. Service was good but the food was awful. Ordered all the ceviches and out of the 5 only two were good. The other 3 smelled like rotten fish and tasted horrible. Also ordered the Paella Marinera. Wow what a disappointment! No flavor what so ever. Downright tasteless. Would not go there ever again.

      Went to Julian Serrano the Friday after New Year's Eve. Had many menu items- green apple salad, chorizo, dates, calamari, ahi tuna, and the pasta paella just to name a few. The food was tolerable, I definitely will not go back.  I was given complimentary Spanish lessons in the bathroom but had to beg to have my water refilled. The ambiance was wonderful (although no one could figure out how to put on the Lakers game...?).

      Our last meal in Vegas found us walking into Julian Serrano out of sheer convenience.  If you've read any of my reviews at ARIA, you'll know that I couldn't wait to leave, much less rush back to my room after an uninspiring massage to check out and leave my bags with the porter because they were "unable" to extend an additional hour to me to enjoy the spa facilities after my treatment.  Anyhow, we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of our meal and service at Julian Serrano.  We noticed that a different server brought out each of the dishes, and our drinks were replenished immediately.  (Managers seemed friendly, courteous and comfortable, not uptight and angry-looking like others around the hotel.)  Spanish tapas are quite different from, say, Italian preparations.  So, one should not disparage the Pan Manchego and expect chunky bruschetta.  The Pan Manchego was a perfect start with excellent flavor.  In fact, pretty much everything we ordered was excellent.  The gazpacho came with the vegetables chopped up and elegantly arranged in a bowl, over which the waiter then poured the puréed tomato base (again, not chunky as we might be used to).  Tuna tiradito was nice, but very small portioned.  Hubby asked the waitress if there were live octopi in the back because the dish we had was the freshest and most tender pieces we've ever had.  I've already forgotten what else we ordered, but I do remember the luscious chocolate cake, which was molten in the middle and paired with a mango sorbet.  Nothing spectacular or out of the ordinary, but a simple and good ending to the meal.  What a relief to have experienced this finally during our stay.  If only the rest of the ARIA resort was operating at this level...

      Went here Dec 31 last year for lunch. The place was extremely crowded, and it was very hard to get a table without any reservation. Bar seats are available on first-come first-serve basis. We were lucky to get our seats at the bar within 20 minutes.   After we got the seats, it took us another 15 minutes before a waiter came to approach us. Slow service, but it could be because the place was so totally new and disorganized.  We order 4 dishes and sangrias. Grilled baby squids, charcutterie platter, spanish omellete (or pizza?), and mushroom risotto. Grilled baby squids tastes fresh and well seasoned. The portion is a bit small. (B+) Spanish omellete is very good. Tasty and the portion is decent. (A-) Charcutterie is overrated and overpriced for the price that is charged. The meat is sliced so paper thin and the ham is dry that I barely can taste what it is supposed to be like. The chorizo is the only salvation in this dish. (B-) Mushroom risotto is quite good, but again, the portion is pretty small. (B) Sangria is good, but a bit on the pricier side. (B)  Service is B because although it is slow, our waiter is quite friendly and attentive after he notices us.  Hence, I can only give 3 stars for this restaurant.

      Julian Serrano is an upscale tapas bar that is wonderful. Food is pretty traditional but the presentation takes it to the next level.  Portions are pretty small even for tapas but worth the money.  Standouts included the chicken croquetas, the shrimp ceviche, and squid.  One or two items i felt were a tad short of salt but were still good.  Service was great as well.

      stopped in for lunch last week.  service was terrible!!! the server wasnt able to answer basic questions about the food,  he actually gave wrong answers that lead us to order certain things, that then came out as something not expected,  he didnt even offer to take it away for something else since he screwed up! when the food was delivered it was just dropped at the table, no explanation at all of what it was. they have alot of work ahead, kind of sad, seeing the manager is the old GM from Alex at wynn! the food was decent, but not great,  there were highs and lows. we had close to 20 small plates for the group of us, and most was mediochre,  the patatas bravas were the best thing we had. bill came to 250 plus tip for lunch, with no wine/alcohol,  just food and couple of iced teas. i would go back in a few months to see if its worked out but otherwise not worth it!!

      We stopped by for a quick bite for lunch and sat at the bar.  We started off with the sangrias and decided to go with the little ham charcuterie plate.  The sangrias are DELICIOUS. They gave us a little sample of each so we could decide which one to get.. but they were both so good that we decided to get one of each.   The charcuterie plate was wonderful too. It came with toasted bread, the delicious thinly sliced ham and a lovely tomato olive oil puree-type dipping sauce. The flavors were just right.  Also loved the decor...  Looking forward to coming here again to try their croquettes, etc. :)

      This is one of the very best Spanish restaurants we have ever eaten in anywhere in the United States, and certainly rates with some of the better places we've been to in Spain!  We went for dinner (tapas), and everything was phenomenal!  The stuffed dates are so tasty (sweet, crunchy, and salty all at the same time ... and fried to boot!), the fried piquillo peppers were just sooooo good, we wolfed down the whole plate!  The bacalao croquettes (a special) were the most airy and tasty we've had in years, and the deconstructed mediterranean seafood stew was absolutely sublime!  And of course, the Pata Negra Jamon Iberico - well, if you know Pata Negra, enough said!   Pair all that with an outstanding bottle of Alion Ribera del Duero and you have the makings of one fantastic dinner!   Our only dings: the coco chorizo was a disappointment, and they didn't serve bread on the table.  But, hey, who bats 1000?  The service was very good, eventhough it was quite busy, and our sommelier was especially helpful and friendly.  If you like Spanish food (heck, if you like food), do yourself a favor and visit Julian Serrano ... but be sure to have your credit card ready!

      Came her with a business partner on a recent trip.  The lamb chop was delicious - specifically the aioli sauce they put with it!  I also got the potatoes with an aioli sauce.  It was also good but the sauce they put on the lamb chop was better.  My business partner loved the beef and cheese dish.  The service was very friendly and quick and the atmosphere was very calming.    The sangria was just ok but I was impressed that they had white and red sangria.   Dessert is a must try!  We shared the rice pudding and it was the most unique rice pudding I have ever had.  I would definitely come back.  The only downside is that the prices are kind of sttep but that's expected in Vegas.

      Me and some girls from the wedding party came in for lunch and since I wanted to watch football, we sat at the bar.  I try to read some of the other reviews prior to adding my own - we had no issues with service but I think that is often the case at the bar. I can't remember the girls name but she was a doll.  Yes, she reminded us what tapas are / portion size and that items just come out when ready.    I had to search around for a website with a menu because I cannot for the life of me recall what we ate other than pure goodness.  I think this guy did a GREAT post with pics and the menu...you might wanna check this out before going.  I didn't pick this place so I had no idea what to expect.  I'm ok with that, but some people are NOT.  http://www.kevineats.com/2009/12/julian-serrano-las-vegas-nv.htm   There were three of us and we ordered *white ceviche yum  *scallop ceviche - good but I could have skipped *ahi tuna tempura - Yes! Good size piece of ahi.  *tuna-raspberry skewer - looked pretty, tasted good *cheese platter - cheese is my FAVORITE food...but it was just cheese, skip if you need the room. Go for it, if you're nervous about new foods *stuffed piquillo peppers - heaven!! Red pepper with goat cheese? I could have seriously  had minimum 4 orders of this item! *pan manchego - this was GREAT - really bad sounding description but the "fresh tomato sauce" was more chunky tomato than sauce and it was the perfect amount of wetness on the bread...like soggy but not gross soggy, perfect. Just get it...it's awesome *beef and cheese - good.  We did have cocktails but since we were at the bar I saw they had a great selection of spirits.  We did get two desserts the server recommended....I didn't think they were fabulous but the meal was so good I didn't mind.  Skip dessert and get the gelato in Aria.  We discussed going back, the meal was that good.  It is definitely not cheap. It was worth it! Check this place out - sit at the bar!

      I think this could have been closer to 3.5 but I rounded down...it just seemed appropriate given our experience there.  Hubby and I stopped by their first weekend open and in what I hope are just growing pains (and they better grow fast), we had a pretty unimpressive experience.  We wanted a snack so we dropped in during their "snack" hour (2pm to 5pm?).  From the distance, we noted a few people get a table but we also saw that it wasn't busy at all so we excitedly rushed over.  Little did we know frustration and disappointment would ensue.    First thing we were told was that there was to be no seating at the tables.  Only bar and that's first come first serve.  The hostess was a non-nonsense (read: not nice) Eastern European lady who couldn't give a rat's ass if we ate there or not. Well, as luck would have it, there was no available bar seating.  Mean Hostess went away and thankfully a nicer (but no less helpful one) came by.    She ran to the other side of the restaurant and came back saying that they were "cleaning off a table for us" and would be ready momentarily.  Really?  Because Mean Hostess just told us there's no table seating, I thought.  Flash forward 10 minutes - there was no cleaning activity of any kind.  Lies!!  Nice Hostess had disappeared and Mean Hostess was back.  After waiting about 10 more minutes, some people finally got up and left so we ran over to the bar.  Nice Hostess was standing by to direct us to the seats that WE FOUND OURSELVES.  Yeah, where's our "table"? lady?    We were sorely mistaken that service would pick up as soon as we were seated.  Silly us.  We finally got our drink orders in but shame on us for not putting in our food order along with it because...well, we should have.  It took a while longer.  Hubby went with a diet coke and I went with their white sangria which could have been fresher.  One look at the menu and I could see that the experience would be (should be) similar to that of eating at The Bazaar in Los Angeles.  Except...they were "out" of the first three things I tried to order.  The deconstructed seafood stew was just basically seafood spread out on a fancy plate.  The most memorable dish I would have to say was the cheese platter, three Spanish cheeses served with quince paste and some over-charred bread.  I have to say that usually I could get over a long wait or frustrating seating experience if the food is worth it.  It wasn't...and hubby and I left Julian Serrano $80 poorer for a not-great snack.  Maybe we'll go back when the Yelp rating is at least 4 stars.  Here's the final jab in our heart...as we left, they were seating a couple at a table rather than making them wait forever for a bar seat.

      I ate here on a slow Thursday evening with my girlfriend.  The restaurant has a beautiful and elegant interior, but it's open to one of the main Aria throughways, and that makes it feel kind of casual, like a swanky airport lounge.  We were seated right away, but at a table next to a serving station, so we had waiters loitering by us most of the time.  I hate that.  Our drinks, an Estrella and a white sangria, came right away.  Once we ordered, the plates came out in rapid succession.  I highly recommend the potatoes brava, tuna tiradito, spanish charcuterie platter and sautéed spinach.  I do not recommend the lobster croquetas (off-menu) or coca chorizo.  I also had a mixed bag of mixed olives.  We skipped dessert, opting instead to stroll over to Jean Philippe.  I can never fill up on tapas for some reason, but I left satisfied, and it was a good way to start the vacation.

      We headed to City Center for a late dinner before heading out to the clubs for the evening, and picked Julian Serrano because they had vegetarian options on the menu for me.  I have to admit, I was mildly disappointed in our experience at Julian Serrano.  We ordered the mushroom soup, Tortilla Espanola, Shrimp Ceviche, chicken skewers, eggplant/peppers, and mixed Paella (lobster, chorizo, chicken).  The paella was pretty good, but I have definitely had better...for $40, I was expecting it to blow my mind.  The other items were just okay.  The décor was great, the service was excellent, and their menu and wine list looked promising...but frankly, I have had tapas that were ten times better at my favorite dive tapas bar here in San Francisco, for about a third of the price.    I probably wouldn't come running back here the next time I was in Vegas, unless someone else was paying.
