      Lavo is the new nightclub/restaurant located in the Palazzo from the creators of Tao. It opens officially next weekend, but there appeared to be some form of a soft opening this weekend.   Restaurant: They are trying to be some sort of mediterranean fusion tapas place. All dishes are small and pricey ($7 for a slider, $15ish for a small tapas sized sih), and they don't offer any entree sized portions. We tried the kobe burger, fries, twice baked chicken, and a breaded veal dish. All were good, and the standout was the veal dish. Nothing was spectactular. Drinks were tasty and cost $12 each. Atmosphere seemed trendy, but contrived like everything in vegas! Servers in the main part were dressed like crap in jeans and tennis shoes but perhaps this was for the soft opening? We ate in the lounge part and the cocktail watiresses were hot and well dressed.   Nightclub: Even though they weren't even open yet officially and obviously weren't packed, they still made us go through the ridiculous fanfare of going through 6 bouncer checkpoints to get into the club. One guy told us "You're lucky you came now when it's easy to get into... once we start advertising this place is going to get REALLY exclusive!" Ok, ouch, so I'm that ugly that I'm not going to be able to get in once this place gets "cool".. mmmk whatever. Also they made my bf tuck in his button down shirt which I thought was weird.   Anyways, once we got into the nightclub I really didn't feel that impressed. I think Tryst is way better. Although the dancefloors seem to be similar sized, at Tryst you can dance all over the place.. this place was small and cramped outside the dance floor, so I think once this place fills up more the dance floor will get too full. The rest of the place is all VIP/bar area. The bar area was cramped and you definitely had no room to dance if you were standing anywhere but the dance floor. Seemed like it could get annoying.  Ok another issue I had.. so the theme is bathhouse. Kind of a fun/cool theme. HOWEVER they sucked at the decor. It's all black pretty much. There's a bizarre pseudo-sexual ugly painting in the back. There's towel rack handles on the wall in a weird pattern. At Tao they have all these cool bathtubs everywhere but then they build a place called a freaking bathhouse and have no such decor.. it's really odd. I mean the place was pretty and everything, I just wasn't blown away. Also, there's no outdoor part in the club part. There is a patio in the restaurant (however no service out there!), but once you get into the club there is no stepping outside.   Last but not least.. the music. Again, Tryst wins out. They played a lot of "old" songs, but not fun 70's/80's songs.. songs that were just well old. Like Nelly's "ride with me" or Gin and Juice by Snoop. Just lots of songs that are very "tired" but not classics if that makes sense. Either play trendy cool music, or play me some Bon Jovi.. none of this cool 10 years ago crap. Tryst had a nice mix of songs of the moment and 80's stuff. This DJ needs help.   Oh and one last complaint. So the line for this place is OUTSIDE. Yes, it is August and they are going to make you wait outside. We only waited 5 minutes due to the aforementioned emptiness, but if this place ever becomes cool and actually gets a line I would hate waiting outside for an hour + in extreme heat or even the "extreme" cold of the Vegas winter. EIther way , waiting outside blows and that was poor planning on their part.

      Umm we were staying at the Palazzo and they said we still had to pay $20 to get into a club that looks hella dead inside??? You must be on crack Mr. Bouncer guy that needs to get the stick outta your ass. I ain't paying for that shit!   I'd rather walk my ass to the V Bar where it's free and play better music.

      I see Lavo as the "it" place to be in Vegas..super exclusive, and totally worth it..... Ok, so Lavo means to bathe or cleanse, and after a night here, that is just what you will have to do, in a good way. The restaurant is GORGEOUS! From the Moroccan tables, twenty foot ceilings, and the glass/wood screen bridge that leads to the club...they knew what they were doing when they designed this place.  Honestly, this place is beautiful, and it of course doesn't hurt to have Grecian beauties bathing themselves in copper tubs, extremely hot waiters, and cocktail waitresses in short little dresses with AMAZING shoes! The restaurant...where do I begin? Since the girls and I were enjoying a "girl dinner," aka a free dinner because we are hot, we never saw a menu and our waited just brought out food he thought we'd enjoy. So I'll try and describe is as best I can. First came the amuse bouche-deconstructed bloody mary shots....ummm....HELLO DELICIOUS! Tomato sorbet, vodka gelatin, and celery foam.....really, out of this world, if i could eat 12 more....I would Margarita pizza- ok, I thought it was delicious, and so did the girls, but I probly would opt to order the other things first next time... Salmon with black caviar..OMG!!! Order it, my mouth is still watering Borccolini...garlic goodness, excellent side dish PROSCIUTTO FIG PANINI WITH HONEY!!!! I cannot begin to express how wonderful this was, we literally licked the dish....the combination of the salty prosciutto, the sweet lavender honey, and the fig just take you to food orgasm....ORDER THREE!!!! Sadly, we did have a noodle dish and a white fish that I can't remember, but they were good, just not AMAZING The food here was Delicious, and from the other reviews, who orders sliders at a restaurant like this?   The Club has A LOT of stairs going up to it....and on the way up you are greeted by multiple bouncers, fat women being fanned by midgets, and bathing goddesses. Once you enter the club, which is on the small side, so I see it being VERY exclusive, you are greeted by a gorgeous circular bar. There are tables around the dance floor, and one table that is against the wall which has like towel rings on it, so you can stand up on the seats and hold onto the wall while you dance....ummm....GREAT foresight!!! The dancing girls add just what I like in my clubs, and on one more note, the bathroom has a holder for your drink!!!! This place is amazing, it's not very crowded yet, but once word spreads, this place is going to be fantastic.

      A club is only as fun as the people you go with and what you make of it. With that said, I had one helluva time.  The bouncers were friendly, and it was a breeze to get in.  Our table waitress Crystal was adorable and attentive.      They had storage boxes at our table to put our purses in.  Nice touch.  The venue itself was nothing breath taking - not ugly by all means, but for Vegas - usually it has to have some je ne sais quo, right?  The music was typical - hip hop then change - then something else - then change, but all together was fine.  My girls were dancing on tables, having drunken fun.  And thats all that matters.

      Think Tao, but with a Mediterranean twist.  There was this fat ass (of the) African (persuasion) beezy dressed in Egyptian Mediterranean old school getup being fanned with by a midget.  That scared me a little bit.    There wasn't that much people there, probably because it's new.  But I'd come back for the ambiance itself.

      we went on a saturday night and were on the guestlist but the bouncer made us wait outside while he got approval for our group.  whatever.  i guess it was the grand opening for the club and jamie foxx, k-fed, mario lopez, paris hilton, nikki hilton, busta rhymes were all there.  but so what? ha  we didnt have to pay which was nice  its supposedly a restaurant, bathouse, and nightclub.  when you get in, you go up in and to the nightclub.  the restaurant is downstairs.  no idea what or where the bathhouse is.  on our way up there was a black midget fanning a large black lady.  it was a bit alarming.  the place is a bit small with a dancefloor surrounded by tables then a bar surrounded by tables too.  kind of cramped.  i have no idea where they hid all the celebrities.  the only one i saw was jamie foxx.  and i tried to take a picture of him and got blacklisted by the bouncers.  everytime i went near the table they would tell me to please step away.    another plus.  top shelf open bar until 12am! = good times

      We spent some time on the terrace at the hookah bar.  It's was good fun as we had a view of the strip and it was quite relaxed.  I'd recommend it for a low key stop early in the evening although it gets a bit crazier as the night goes on.

      My favorite thing about going to Vegas is trying new clubs, restaurants, and hotels. I was excited yet hesitant to spend my 22nd birthday at Lavo this year (10/10) because of the lack of reviews and hype surrounding the club. I made reservations to Pure as well (one of my all time favorite clubs). After a promoted pretty much talked my group into at least checking it out, the night began.   First off Lavo is TINY. Even with table service, all the tables/couches are squeezed together and it doesn't provide you with the ultimate experience because everyone is stuffed in like sausages and it made it easy for people to just walk up and dance and sit in your space. There was no separation from the regular dancing area.   Second, the service is less than impressive. Our table server Megan was rude did not help make the occasion special but actually took away from the experience.  Third, the music was horrible and even intoxicated found it difficult to dance too.  And finally after only one bottle of kettle one was consumed we were kicked out without warning because they thought my friend was "too drunk". With a whole bottle left you can imagine I was less than thrilled.   I couldn't believe this club shares an owner with Tao, it was awful and I will never be going back. Please don't make the same mistake I did, and go somwhere else (Tao, Pure, LAX, Rain).

      Went there this past Saturday. Got there about 11p, which I felt was still early to go out  for Vegas. Our group wanted to check out this new place since we were staying at The Palazzo. When we get there we tell the clipboard guy we were on the guest list for a group of 20. He pretended to glance at his list and says the name isn't there, then turns away. We told him to keep looking, which he finally did (with an attitude). He saw the name and then said, "With a large group like that you would need 2 tables, which will cost 5k." Are you kidding me?? 5k for a crap place like this! No way Mr. clipboard power trippn' dude. We ended up at Tao with no troubles what so ever. Also, check out V-bar at the Venetian if you're not really in the mood for a club.

      NIGHTCLUB rating only.  I walked in during feasting hours and its cool, small, OK bar. Apparently this is one of the only places to get down on a Sunday. Ladies you can get a 2 ladies in free flyer at Tao - so get there early and you dont pay.  It also says on the club flyer that its a bathouse. Um NO. I got kicked out of line for wearing rhinestone open toed shoes in flip flop style. OK a girl with ugly kitten heel flea market flip flops got in and I didn't? WTF. I explained the the very cool bouncer who was going to let me in - since I was just meandering around alone - look the flyer said bath house, I have heels, but I have my hot-piece suit on under and I can put my heels on. I was even going to tip the guy for putting me in GList line.  So I step to the side for 2 minutes, show him my fabulous heels and then I am told that they are at max capacity and I can wait in their lounge. I think it was some senior bouncer that cut me off. What a load of crap. I dont know - did they not like my flossy Obama top? I was already stamped for entry - WTF?  Lavo - awash.

      This has to be one of the best Nightclub experiences i've ever had.  Im from LA and have been on the club scene for 10+ years.  I'm kind of done with the club scene, but found myself in Vegas for a bachelorette party. We got a table at LAVO and the service and treatment was top-notch all the way.  I was beyond impressed and i'm a tough cookie to impress.  We had 2-3 waitresses for our group of 12 girls and they took care of us all the way.  I would compare it to the service I've gotten at a St Regis Hotel.  We also had our 1st bottle comp'd.  Additionally the club itself is beautiful. Gorgeous details and interesting things to see everywhere. The crowd was great too, good looking, classy for Vegas.  (We were at Prive the night before the the low-rent crowd there was SCARY- people stealing red bull cans off our table and sticking them in their purses with no bouncers around anywhere).  Back to the LAVO review....And to top it off, I ended up losing my passport there somehow!  They found it the next day and Fed Ex'd it back to me immediately. Way to go LAVO - you get high marks in my book!!!!

      place was packed.  we were told 20 minute wait but ended up being an hour.  the manager bought us a drink in the meantime, though, which was nice, especially with their prices.  almost impossible to get a drink at the bar.  loud and annoying house music blasting and douchebags and douchebaguettes abound, but the food was good and the menu interesting.  worth a try when you've got $300 free to blow on dinner for two, which i always do...

      Food was fantastic! It was SO loud I felt like i was screaming during dinner...didn't completely ruin it but I am undecided if I would go back. Keeping in mind, it was 7:30pm, not 10:00pm. A bit disappointing.

      Really liked the place. We stayed at Palazzo and I asked our concierge to put us on their guest list. This said we didn't have to pay and easily got inside around midnight. I'd say it's a little small, but music was good and drinks pretty good too. A night before we went to Tryst and I think these two are comparable in quality (besides the dance floor size).

      i lava lavo.  i went here for dinner on a saturday night. the place is so hip and cool.. with dim lights everywhere and fancy chandeliers and modern, dark decoration.  very nightclubby feel..its a pretty intimate setting, with candles and they had couches you can sit at for dinner.  i started with their very good onion soup, served in a little miniature pot.  it had bacon bits, lots of onions inside and melted cheese on top, of course. For my main course i ordered the linguine with clams, which was overall not that great.. it was super salty.  I regret not ordering the steak frites with bleu cheese melted on top of it with fries. (i had a bite of it from someone else's plate and the steak was damn good.) For dessert i had their AMAZING chocolate pudding, with ice cream on the side.. so very delicious.    i think my decision to give this place a 4 instead of a 3 was because of their onion soup and chocolate pudding.  their portions are small, but if you have 3 courses you will be very satisfied.  it was $30 per person, all 3 courses included.  (alcoholic) beverages are a little much. but its vegas.  turns to a nightclub at night.. which i havent been to, but want to.

      I went to Lavo during the current promotion providing a $50. 00 drink credit at the bar and lounge. How can you top a $50.00 gift certificate ......... That baby turned into four high quality Blackberry margaritas, each served with a large amount of Patron silver.  You can not complain about the quality of the drinks in this bar. Service is excellent, bar tenders are quick and efficient and the wait staff is supurb. Friendly people everywhere.....  The lounge is very large and was filled with early evening drinkers and diners. The seating looks quite comfortable. The bar holds about 20 patrons..... I would think this would be an enjoyable club when the evenings are comfortable enough to go on the terrace and enjoy a Shisha pipe or hooka as some people call them.  The charge for the set up is a bit steep, but still would afford you and your friends an excellent experience.  I tried their Beef Kabobs, with Olive polenta, scallions and lime - they were outstanding. I also dined on the Kobe meatballs - also very nice. The menu has a large variety of selections -  including Spanish Payae. dishes.  I found Lavo to be a quality experience. A club in the making .... I hope they do well.

      No cover and a short line.  Good first impression.  The lounge/club is upstairs and you can view the restaurant while taking the short hike on up.  The restaurant was beautiful and spacious.  What happened to the club?!  It was intimate, but a little tooooo intimate.  It was tiny!  The dance floor was the size of my hotel room.  The decor was nice, but I wasn't impressed.  The little person fanning the lady on top was about the only thing that was somewhat interesting.   It wasn't crowded and it seemed to be a sugar daddy/sugar baby haven.  Attractive young ladies dancing and old, rich men staring.

      I stayed at the Venetian and got a drink voucher, So after losing money in the casino, I said what the hell. I didnt go to the club cause I was starving  and needed to eat Is that why the food  was so good? the service was outstanding and did I mention the FOOD WAS GREAT! the waitress suggested  ordering a few different plates, everything from the Mai Tai to the Kobe Steak was very good!

      I was there last Saturday for dinner and went upstairs to check out the club. For the restaurant, the decor/ ambiance was great if that's what you're looking for. The food was just ok, have tasted better tapas in numerous other places. I tried the kobe beef balls, kobe sliders, grill octopus salad, sea bass and clam linguine. None of those amazed me or stayed in my tongue memory. The chocolate bread pudding was the best part of the whole dinner.   I had fun staring at the people walking back and forth the stairs/ bridge to the club so i checked it out after dinner. It has a bar area and a dance floor area with some booths. I guess it would be ok if you're hanging out with your own group of friends and is looking for something less hectic than the bigger clubs. The crowd cleared out pretty fast because of the size of this place i suppose, and not many people there after 1am on a Saturday night.

      For food! This is a must! They have a preTheatre Menu which is what i go when i went. It's 30% but you get an appetizer, main course and dessert. But I went with a group and tried everything! The pizza! The best! Thin and made perfectly, The Ceaser Salad, also very good. Very fresh Linguine Vongole - 4/5 (but not my thing, could be yours!) Caramelized Salmon - 5/5 (It fell apart easily, and wasn't your typical fish flavor.) Herb Grilled Chicken Paillard -  5/5(I didn't think Chicken could taste so many different flavors at once) Streak Frites 100/5 It was agreed that we all eat this one slowly and savor each bite. The streat came out thin and displayed beautiful with sauce. It was tender, it was juicy, we didn't want dessert we wanted more of that! If you come here ORDER THEM!   Dessert was great, the cookies, the ice cream. The normal desserts. But the streak by far was the best.  I don't think we could have tipped the staff well enough for their display, their helpfulness and overall knowledge of the food.   The place is dim, and beautiful and a morroccon retreat. There is also and outside area that faces T.I so if you go at the right time like i did. You can see the Sirens of T.I show. But.. it's not a must!   Again i got the Pretheater pre Fix deal but! Prices were not extremely expensive which i thought it would considering this is in the Palazzo.  Please this place is defenitly five star and i'm taking everyone i know there.

      Ok I had to 4 Star this one or else the designer would hang me by the Moroccan light fixtures lol.   Over all the decor is amazing (wink) but the food definitely steals the show. Not a Bloody Mary fan but the shots were our addiction that night.   A must visit if you want to do the total package of dinner/ lounge/bar 1 place call it a night, outing.   One of the better places in Vegas and I'd say a decent spin off from Tao that holds it's own.

      Lavo is located in what I consider to be the best casino hotel on the strip; Palazzo. Decor is modern Moroccan and they have a restaurant, club, and hookah lounge. The service is fast (perhaps too much so) and the food is great. Unique dishes, but not unrecognizeble. The cocktails are unique and fresh as well. The one drawback is their liberal application of sauces. Our dishes were good but would have been better with less sauce. Might want to specify this when ordering. Other than that, Lavo is worth the visit.

      i truly AM in love with lavo....it's much better the second time.  good food, cool bathroom sinks, my favorite chocolate pudding cake thing they have..with dulce de leche sauce and vanilla ice cream, and good times. went here for a second time with a group of friends, to celebrate birthdays and an engagement!  lavo was great about taking our reservation of 13.  we waited a little bit to be sat.. the service was good. we all ordered something different.. so for our group of 4 in one area of the table decided to get a bunch of different kinds of dishes to share..   what we ordered: -bone-in ribeye..which came with 4 different dipping sauces  (all so freakin good.) tender steak and delish sauces. -paella..which had seafood, chicken and chorizo! soo tasty. -kobe meatball..that had some marinara sauce deal with it. (which was comped, because they forgot to bring it out, yay!) also awesome. -fries with their ketchup sorbet (cold ketchup)..weird..never had that before. -margherita pizza...which had potatoes...lobster! and caramelized onions. so different.   we didn't end up going to the club upstairs afterwards, but it looked pretty busy and cool.  like last time.. loved the super modern decor and random decorations..  i want to be there every time i'm in vegas.

      I've been to Vegas so many times but I've never really checked or heard of this place until this past weekend. We met up with some Toronto friends in Vegas and decided to party it up VIP style. We decided to get bottle service since that's how we roll. hahah j/k anyways, the place was really nice and it was nestled in the corner of The Palazzo. I assume its a restaurant by day and a club/lounge by night. The decor was amazing and the staff were really friendly. They play great music and the tables (for bottle service) were a little small.

      came in on a thursday night looking for a low-key start to the weekend.  we walk up to the front (no line to be seen) and were told we weren't getting in without a table because there were too many of us (16 people and pretty much an even female/male split - wtf!)  we were only required to get one bottle so we said what the hell.  you've got the vegas table surcharge so we were on deck to pay around $500 for a bottle of Grey Goose that you get at BevMo for $40.  we walk in and it's DEAD!    on the plus side the bottle we got was the magnum size Goose bottle.  we finished the bottle around 12:30 and the waitress asked us if we wanted another one.  none of us were looking to blow our wad on the first night, so we passed.  the waitress comes back ten minutes later and says they'll give us two-for-one.  Us being chinamen, we couldn't pass up a deal, even if we didn't want to drink anymore (and i think they knew that).  Sale on vodka in vegas?   who can pass on that?  that shit never happens!  we ended up drinking about 3/4 of one bottle.  but again, we're chinamen so we couldn't let the rest go to waste, especially if we paid for it.  we bought a few bottled waters, downed them and emptied the leftover Geese into the water bottles under the table to save for a rainy day.      NOTE: the two-for-one isn't probably going to be offered on a good, busy night.  it was dead when we went so they were probably trying to make as much money as they could off of us...bastards.

      When?: Saturday, December 20  Who?: Me plus five  Bottom Line: Lavo is a very small club with average music and slow and not very knowledgeable bartenders.  The only thing I really liked about it were the bathrooms, which were never crowded, even after the club got packed.  You can get in for free if you stay at the Palazzo and tell the concierge you want to go to Lavo.  I'd probably come back if I was staying at the Palazzo again and didn't feel like leaving the hotel to go to a better club.

      I reallllly wanted to like this place!!  Unfortunately, it's hard to enjoy going to a nightclub when the place is just plain DEAD!  The bouncers were really nice, which was awesome.  They weren't snotty or anything and we didn't have to pay a cover charge.  We walked in around 11pm on a Thursday night and it was really empty.  We left for a while, came back around 12:30am and there were a lot more people.  Unfortunately, not too many people were dancing.  I think it had a lot to do with the music selection since there were a few songs where people would run out and dance to, then go back to their drinks after it was over.  I suppose I could blame the dead dance floor on the DJ.  I really liked the small intimate dance floor.  The whole place had a nice vibe to it, but it was just so dead we wound up leaving in less than an hour.  They were playing better music downstairs in the restaurant area!

      we stayed at the venetian, and got comp passes and drink vouchers. didn't have to wait in line, and got served incredibly strong drinks even while paying with vouchers! nice!  the club itself is small, but nice. the decor is really neat, with cool fixtures in the bathroom. the water at the sink comes from above, making quite a splash but still pretty awesome! we went on a sunday night, with a group of nine.. the dance floor was packed, and the crowd was mixed, yet not the most attractive. lots of dudes.   i had a great time simply because i got so many free drinks with the vouchers. ($50/suite, two suites = 6 top-shelf shots &amp; 2 mixed drinks &amp; a redbull)   check this place out if simply to see the decor. could do without the mediocre music, and the "whatever" looking crowd. maybe it's better on a friday or saturday night?

      LAVO Restaurant. Bathhouse. Lounge/Nightclub.   What the hell is a bathhouse? The only thing I could make from it was that there were about 20 sinks lined up in a row on the way up to the dance floor. Go figure, I was confused!   The first floor is more loungey, chill, relaxing. The second floor consists of the 20 sinks I just mentioned. And the third floor is where you shouldn't go if you're epileptic. Strobe lights going, people dancing, dark then bright, loud, etc. I couldn't see much up here since it was mostly dark all the time but after say 10 minutes, we left.   Maybe I'll come back next time...but for now, it's definitely not one of Vegas' most poppin' clubs.
