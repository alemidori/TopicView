      It is a little bland.  At least it isn't so smoky yet.  You'd think maybe they would prohibit smoking here, but no, that doesn't appear to be the case.    It makes it easier to get to the Venetian.  It's operating under the same permit as the Venetian, so it is essentially just an addition.  Same management.

      It is a bit difficult wrting a review before the hotel officially opens. However .. I have reservations for a room this week and decided to check out what I thought would be one of the jewels of the strip.  The lobby of the hotel is supurb. An excellent sculpture and fountain sits below a glass domed ceiling (photo included). There is convenient access from the Venetian from either the Grand Canal shops or by the Blue Man Group theatre box office. The casino seems to be a bit understated for what I expected from his hotel.  The entrance to the Palazzo three story shopping area is accented by a one story waterfall. The Venetian wanted to get the hotel open before the 140,000 delegates of the CES convention showed in the city so there are a few things not quite ready as one might expect. All in all, an excellent addition to Las Vegas. Looks to be a super four star rating. ~~~~~~~~~~ After staying at the Palazzo I have to update my rating an extra star. In the evening, we had come to the room prepared to mix a few drinks. The rooms are copies of the suites at the Venetian - as one might expect. Very plush and all the needed accessories. We noticed while we were out the maid had turned down the bedding and left the Godiva chocolate on the pillows and ... the maid had placed ice into the ice bucket in the room.  Small little touches like that exist all around the hotel to make your stay a supurb experience.  The staff was most helpful with all our needs The under ground parking garage has elevators and escalators in several locations making your transition to the hotel very easy. ( not like the mile walk you experience at the MGM from their parking garage) Our first stay was very memorable.

      Palazzo is niiiice!  It's one of those upscale hotels like Mandalay Bay, Caesar's Palace, The Venetian and Wynn.  You gotta have money in order to shop at Palazzo, especially in the mall sharing with The Venetian.  It does take forever to get a damn drink.  The bartenders are too busy making drinks for waitresses or talking with each other.  My friend and I had to flag down 3 bartenders before we were finally given attention.  So sorry that I don't look like Trump before getting fast service.  (Not that I want to look like Trump.)

      I tried Palazzo during their opening during CES. they got the reservations incorrectly. The rooms are nice (just like Venetian). The hot water didn't really work.  Some of the electrical faceplates and details not done in the room. The hot water took 15 minutes or more to get hot. Oh, they didn't clean my room until Midnight one night after I called several times to the hotel front desk to call me. The hotel entrance and some of the elevator banks smelled like sewer- so awful! Not sure if it's worth the $400 bucks they will be charging you if you have to go through so much pain.

      Beautiful hotel, but they opened way too early.  Stayed there for my hubby's conference.  Beautiful, spacious rooms, but no cold water in the shower the whole time we were there, even after calling various times.  Concerns were expressed, to no avail.  I guess they had to start paying back their mortgage ASAP!!!  The casino is beautiful and very spacious.  High ceilings, which is rare in the Vegas casinos.  Makes it less claustrophobic and pleasant.   To be continued...

      I was here for the Grand Opening of the Palazzo, and writing a review after staying here...(not just reading what it says on the website) anyways, having always been a fan of the Venetian, its the same.  The rooms are arranged exactly the same way as the suites at the Venetian, and the only difference is the non-venice theme at the Palazzo. They just opened, so still have a few kinks needed to be fixed, but the casino is clean, same dealer staff from the Venetian, and pleasant.  The restaurants are another story, but that will go under another category.   My company is at The Palazzo too! Id give them a few more months to get it together and make some fixes.

      We were at the Palazzo for the Grand Opening weekend for my friend's Bachelorette party and it's EXACTLY like the Venetian. The rooms are super spacious (about 700 sq. feet) and in addition to the "bedroom" area, there's the little living room space that has an L shaped couch, desk, etc.  Super NEW....everything smelled brand new and I didn't feel gross walking around without shoes.    The casino is also really clean - although there was this smell that resembled the smell of a stink bomb that we kept smelling.  Wasn't sure if we were just trippin or not.   We ate at the cafe/restaurant there (The Lux....I think)....reminded me of Cheesecake Factory - extensive menu list and so did the ambiance. Very reasonable prices too.   One thing that sucked, was that we were debating whether or not to play craps before or after lunch.....so we figured they wouldn't raise the minimum ($10) to anything higher within the next hour or so.  BUT THEY DID...raised it to $15 by 3pm.  OH well...

      Maybe I just built it up too much in my mind thinking it was going to rival the big guns like Wynn or Bellagio.  It doesn't.  The casino is spacious but just seemed kinda whatever.  I'd rather just play at Venetian (at least the poker is over there too).    The shopping area was cool, ofcourse not much seemed open but the atmosphere was nice.  I did notice that the music they played didn't fit with the look of the place.  Santana and Avril are good for Planet Hollywood but it just seems like  a clusterF here.  Pavarotti would've been more appropriate.    I thought we'd hang around here for at least an hour or so but we were back in the parking lot off to somewhere else in less than that.  I'm sure the rooms are nice though.

      I agree with Phillip T's review below.  I had high expectations for this new casino, but when we walked in, it looked average.  Nothing really wowed me, except....  THE SHOPPING and THE RESTAURANTS.    Barneys, need I say more?   I also look forward to checking out CUT!

      I just came back from my visit to the Palazzo and I have to say that I was not very impressed.  I was lucky enough to have been able to stay at the Wynn on my previous trip and like one of the other comments mentioned, I expected that the Palazzo would rival the Wynn or Belagio.  Sadly it really is no where close in comparison.  The hotel itself is nice, but nothing more.  Very simply decorated and nice, clean rooms.  Nothing very exciting in the ways of the casino and I was quite dissapointed that the hotel was open, but hardly any shops are, other than Barneys.  I had one meal at Jade Restaurant in the hotel, and that probably was the best part of the experience.  So, considering the price to stay there and my other options next time, I think I will opt for another hotel.

      I fully admit that this review is completely biased.  I mean, really, my friend got a suite here for free (yes, that's how he rolls), so I got to stay in a room that was above and beyond "normal" rooms.  It was ridiculous.  The suite was bigger than my house and bigger than my gf's condo (she stopped by to check the place out).  As my friend Alice would say, "Sick."  Beautiful vanity table with free Bare Escentuals make-up, two high definition televisions, a gorgeous couch to recline on, free fridge stocked with all sorts of goodies, it was awesome.  After walking around Vegas this weekend and numerous other times before, all casinos start to look the same.  But what sets this one apart from the others is the lobby.  OMG.  I don't know what kind of "perfume" or "scent" is emitted through the lobby, but it is so beautiful.  It reminds me of my Viktor &amp; Rolf "Flowerbomb" perfume.  Very classy.

      There is just so much hype behind the Palazzo that you can't help but be disappointed when you find out how incomplete it is.  Ultra high end stores are open with designs you can do nothing short of laugh at.  OK, so it has 5600 rooms.  The shopping area is incomplete and the Bellagio and Wynn casinos still feel nicer.   Not impressed.

      We stayed at the Palazzo this past weekend and had a great experience.  We have not stayed at the Venetian or the Wynn before, so I am not sure how it compares to them.  We booked the Palazzo through Priceline and only paid $140 per night when rooms were retailing on the Palazzo's website for $350 per night.  Check-in was incredibly smooth...we checked in a little after 3 and it took less than 10 minutes from the time we parked the car until we had a room key.  The room was incredibly spacious....the only negative was our view. We were on the back and had a rather unpleasant view of alleyways and service entrances for the different surrounding businesses and hotels.  Checkout went very smoothly as well, and the morning we were leaving, we arranged for late checkout which was not a problem at all.  The casino at the Palazzo is small and pretty basic, so it wouldn't warrant a stop unless you were staying there.  It's nice that it is connected to the Venetian, and there is elevator access to the Canal Shops and the Canyon Ranch spa.  My huge negative about the Palazzo is it was impossible to get a taxi on Saturday night a little before 6 pm.  In fact, we had to get a towncar because the taxi line moved incredibly slow and I think for 10 minutes, I did not see one cab pull up.  We had to spend more money than we wanted for towncar service, but it was necessary to make sure we weren't super late to dinner.  I would recommend that if you need a taxi, just walk over to the Venetian because your luck will probably be better there.  UPDATE (6/3/08): I was in Vegas this past weekend with some girlfriends and we booked the Palazzo via Priceline for $207/night.  Again, a very nice experience especially as we were able to get early check-in.  Upon arriving, we decided to check out the pool. Blah. Bad idea. It took us almost 45 minutes to finally get a cocktail waitress to come over despite asking five different employees to send one over. I understand it's a big area, but we never even saw a waitress walk around until she finally came over. Once we got her over to us once, she was good about checking on us continually.  There is a little cafe outside of the pool area where you can order food to go, but I did not find the menu very impressive at all. I think if you have a cabana, you must have a different menu (I think the same one as Tao Beach).  Personally I would skip the Palazzo pool and just head over to the Venetian for Tao Beach.

      We recently stayed at the Palazzo as it just opened and it kicked ass!  Being that we are 'players' at the Venetian, we were comped a suite at the Palazzo and it was super sweet ~  As soon as we arrived in Vegas, both of us came down with Bronchitis :(   But, I have to say, if I was going to be stuck in a hotel room, this was a good place for it.  The suite was huge and very quiet and comfortable. Once we did venture out, the Casino was fun and inviting.  The dealers were personable and made it fun to play there.  Even though we eventually lost (as expected), at least we had a good time doing it.  The cocktail waitresses were a little slow - but, they're probably still figuring things out as they've only been open a little while.  The Palazzo connects to the Venetian and all the shops and entertainment there and is just across the street from the Wynn.  So, if you're tired of the other end of the strip - this place is cool.

      Thanks to that girl that said to me at the blackjack table to my boss, "boy, your friend is a jerk."  And then I told the ex-girlfriend story. Then she understood why I was a jerk.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a nice place -- the room was roomy, perfectly appointed (or I didn't care, I wasn't paying for it). The WiFi worked (always a plus). The staff is almost overly polite, and pretty much will get you what ever you need. They were actually too helpful, because sometimes I just want to be left alone. ;)  A little less gimmicky than the Venetian, which I appreciate because I'm not too hip on those theme hotels anymore. So you get blackjack dealers dressed classy, not in some costume like Hooters or the Rio.  They do get minus one point for the iPod someone swiped out of my bag.

      Being a fan of the Venetian hospitality and spacious rooms, I was delighted to see the modernized version, cute ass decor of the rooms at The Palazzo.   We stayed here for my bachelorette party and it was perfect!! It wasn't as busy as the other hotels on the strip, and the lobby had a nice calmness about it. Beautiful flowers, sculptures, and music playing overhead. It was great. Everyone was uber-friendly and polite.   And they had an Espressamente Illy Cafe! OMG! I love Illy coffee! I don't care if its $5!!  I would love to give this place 5 stars, but...  1) Tthere was a hole in one of our walls, where the door stopper used to be  2) The front desk clerk said she called in our luggage and we waited over an hour to get it, because she really didn't call it in.   3) Their machines sucked up all my gambling money! One would think their machines would be paying out since they are new, but whatever, its just funny money right??  4) Shopping area wasn't totally done yet and neither was the pool.

      This hotel is still very new, so realize they are still working out the kinks.  Operationally, its a nightmare but the rooms were very nice.  I'm sure if I visit them in a year (which I will NOT, but hypothetically) it would probably be alright.  Casino has PLENTY of riff raff if that's what you're into.  I am not.  Hard Rock Casino still has my vote as #1.  At least you expect riff raff there.

      Great value for the money at approx $300/night for a large suite.  I've stayed twice and both times scored a room on the 33rd floor overlooking the Wynn golf course.  I've stayed at the Venetian, TheHotel, Hard Rock, new tower at Caesars, and many others and being at a brand new hotel actually worth the money was a nice change.  While i love TheHotel, the prices are getting out of control, and i feel that the Palazzo room can compete.  There are 3 TVs in the room, a small flat screen in the bathroom, and two in the suite, the first facing the sleeping area and the second in the lower lounge area.  The sitting area is the most impressive with a large L-shaped couch with enough space to seat at least 6 and a nicely sized dining table with 4 chairs.  In the corner is a small desk and chair.  The hotel itself has great restaurants and is attached to the Venetian for even more variety.  The Palazzo shops continue to expand upon the introduction of the first and only Barney's in Las Vegas.   The only downside to this property is that I couldn't determine if it had it's own pool.  We walked to the Venetian pool, which was quite a trek through the maze of the Canyon Ranch Spa.  I'm staying again in September and for any other last minute trips, i'll be sure to try this first.  I sure hope the rates don't get jacked!

      Of all my Vegas hotel experiences this one has been one of my favorites.  Its not the party atmosphere of the Hard Rock but it serves a great purpose.  (Unlike CP or the Venetian its not that crowded and its easy to get around)  Most of the things I like in Vegas are at the Venetian- Tao, Bouchon, V-Bar......but I didn't like staying at the Venetian.  Now I can have everything I want right there but without all the things that I didn't like at the Venetian.    The Palazzo is the Venetian's answer to THEHotel.  The theme of is "nice".  If you need roller coasters and pirates go elsewhere, perhaps Disney.  I enjoyed the casino, it was easily manageable in size with plenty of room for people to walk without feeling herded like cattle.  I was pleasantly surprised to find $15 black jack tables.  The Palazzo is not overrun with children, its less crowded in general and much easier to get around.  And they pipe a nice smell throughout the hotel.  The room was a lovely less gauche version of the Venetian rooms.  The large sectional couch works better for hosting friends in your suite than the small pull out couch.  The beds were much more comfortable than its sister hotel.  You still get the same huge bathroom with the double sinks but everything is understated.  We had a small emergency when we were there, my husband broke a champagne flute and stepped on a piece of glass....his foot would not stop bleeding.  The hotel staff were on top of their game and cleaned up and bandaged his foot so we could go to the hospital.    The only drawback was the cab situation that Melissa H. described.  Knowing that for future trips I would just walk over to the Venetian to get one.  Also, if you are driving into Vegas the entrance to the Self Park is on Sands.

      The rooms itself were really nice.  Its a more modernized version of the room compared to the Venetian.  Has an interesting sweet smell of wood in the hallway.... oh yea... parts of it are still under construction.  As for the casino def one of my top favs on the strip, it's basically a big square room but you feel more relaxed because of it and its bright not like it's counter part where its dark and packed.  Def. a great hotel however we tried to check in early and the Asian guy at the check-in desk said no because they were totally booked and there are no rooms open.  Wrong guy to lie to buddy considering we booked the room two days before.  And we tried again an hour later and the girl gave us a room. asian guys i tell ya............

      Out of all the hotels that I have been in Vegas, This is by far the best one! You get priority at TAO nightclub and they are surrounded by top notch stores. Our stay here was great. We had 15 people with us and no one ever complained about the noise.

      The Palazzo definitely holds one of the nicest rooms.  The layout of the suites were awesome.  Two huge beds, two big screen HD tv's.  The beds were soo comfortable - it was like lying on a fluffy cloud.  The bathrooms were pretty big and even had a TV.    Only downsides were that I didn't think like how the bathrooms didn't have any vent(s).  that was a major dissapoint, especially since there were a lot of guys in our room...and coming back from dinner was a disaster lol.  also didn't like the hallway decor as much as other places, but it was alright.  The palazzo casino is really spacious, not sure if that was necessary.    I would give this place 3.5 stars, but i'm sure in the next few years they will improve the hotel a lot.

      Pros: Great decor Cons: Smaller casino  It's pretty nice here.  The rooms are laid out EXACTLY like the Venetian, but just with different decor.  Personally, I like the decor here a lot better than the Venetian since it's more contemporary.  Anyway, we had about 8 people crammed in our room and it was actually pretty comfortable.  There are 2 queen sized beds and 1 sofa pull out bed. The rooms also have 2 flat screen HDTVs. The bathroom is really nice too.  There's a bathtub and a shower. There's also a TV inside too.  The only problem is the bathroom doesn't have any vents.  Not a big deal, just different.  As a casino, there isn't really much for me here since I love playing poker.  I have to walk over to the Venetian to play.  It's not that far of a walk, but I'm pretty lazy :)  Other than that, this place is great!

      One word: GORGEOUS  Palazzo is still relatively new so it's got the fresh look and feel to it.  The rooms are really spacious and perfect for up to 5 people to stay in comfortably (but i have to say, i was happy that we didnt have to accommodate that many).  The pool is really great but unfortunately doesn't get the early  morning sun so the majority of the pool area isn't truly enjoyable until about noon.  Kinda blows if you want to get your pool time in in the late morning so you can go spend the rest of your day doing something else (like...gamblings or shopping).  But definitely go back when the sun is out in the early afternoon.  The bar's great and the pool chairs that are sitting in the water are awesome.   A couple of complaints that brought it down a star:  - check in delays.  We got there at 7:30pm. We didnt get into our room until nearly 9pm because they were cleaning.  Seriously?  - Restaurants choice.  The only restaurant i really wanted to try was Cut, other than that, it was pretty slim pickings.  We ended up going over to Palazzo's sister hotel (The Venetian) and having dinner a Tao on our last night.  AMAZING.  There'll be a separate review that one visit.

      Love the room! It was nice. We stayed for 4 days 3 nights. Room was spacious and clean. Bath tub is on a smaller scale compare to Wynn. Motorized blind was not working properly but we didn't stay in the room too long, so we didn't care too much. Slot machines were ok, not too "tight".  Food was expensive but that's every where in Vegas.  Overall, we had a great time in the hotel. But, if you ask me to pick between Pallazo and Wynn, I would go with Wynn in a heart beat! Wynn rocks!!!

      I am not a fan.  Perhaps it is the proximity to the superior Wynn, which seems to have luxury AND a soul.  Or maybe I just don't like themeless slot warehouses that set their sights so low as to try to imitate a boring Beverly Hills luxury mall in their design.  Look!  We've got overpriced glittery stuff!  With Eye-talian labels!  Fancy!     Palazzo gets one star for the funky little jazz bar next to the Jersey Boys Theater, that place rocks.  The rest of the place is like the Nordstroms of Vegas casinos.  Bleh.

      If I didn't judge things on their appearance, the Palazzo would have received no stars at all. Thank goodness I was here on business and didn't incur the costs of staying here, because that would have resulted in a huge upset for the company.  I arrived at the hotel and was very impressed by the beautiful foyer- large, airy and lots of marble. The casino still maintained a virginal sparkle as the place hadn't been open long enough to have absorbed the dirty remains of old cigarettes. My room, the Bella Suite  was in impeccable condition...complete with three plasmas, a hot tub and a sunken living room. Well... impeccable until i had no running water, the electronic curtains wouldn't close, and no WiFi for a week.  Granted, the hotel had only been open two weeks -- but that shouldn't matter. If you're opening a luxury hotel on the STRIP in VEGAS you should *probably* iron out them kinks before anyone steps foot in the doors, especially because of how influential customer reviews are these days. However, being a negotiating fiend, i weaseled my way into 2 free nights at a later date and $300 worth of food comps.   Crap, those commies just suckered me into going back.   :-/

      This is for the mall, not the hotel/casino. The Palazzo was nice - the stores again very high-end like the Venetian. Loved the 2-3 story waterfall and fountains. However, I felt it was very much like other high-end malls back east, with less unique flair, and especially since it is connected to the Venetian I was expecting more. Overall worth a poke around if you're in the Venetian, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here.

      This is the perfect hotel to stay with your "girls" for a weekend of debauchery. When Jessica and I walked in we immediately thought it looked like the hotels in the Arabian Gulf with its tall ceilings, gorgeous fountains and palm trees.  This is new Las Vegas, baby.  The suites are very nice and modern and sexy.  The red velvet chaise lounges are perfect for a that glam pre-party photo shoot, and the suite is perfect for post-party lounging. The beds are super soft and I'm already thinking about taking my mid-day nap tomorrow on piles of down pillows. After party in our room?  You know it!
