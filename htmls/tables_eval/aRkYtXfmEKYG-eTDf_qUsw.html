      Great atmosphere and music.  I definitely believe that Lux has the best coffee I've ever had at this point.  Screw all my previous reviews - this place has coffee down.  They make damn good toast too.  Mmm.

      Pretty yummy coffee, with a very personal touch on the cup, as they put an adorable little sticker with your name and drink on each cup.

      Just don't walk in while they're roasting, you'll have to go home immediately and change.  Your clothes will smell like burnt chocolate, or, um roasted coffee beans.  Not my favorite aroma.

      Best cappicino in Phoenix, the artwork is always amazing. But do not ask the barista to make you something that's not on the list or if they have WiFi. Other than that, this place is great. Oh, and the italian toast with blackberry jam..... *starts drooling*

      i love, love, love lux coffee.  can't drink it there as the place is always too packed.  could sit on the front patio but it's tooooo hot right now.  so i take it with me which is fine.  their coffee is the best in the valley as far as i'm concerned (ok the LGO spanish latte is also dang good).    i have learned to embrace the multiple body piercings as part of the extreme coffee deluxe picture.   that coffee, it's enough to melt a girls heart.  the chocolate chip cookies were incredible at one time.  don't know if they still are.  the woman who used to make them had her mother or grandmothers receipe.  as for the rest of their heavenly offerings, haven't had a bad calorie laden snack there yet.

      This place is really cool, but it has a couple problems: 1) its right on central and we all know central is one hell of a bitch to drive, that and its hard to find  and 2) it doesn't have as spansive of a menu as I would like to see.  sorta 3) too dark during the day. The type of lighting's cool in the evening and night, but during the day it makes me feel like I'm doing a drug run type thing (not to to say I've done so, but its how I would imagine it)  I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the music though. The staff was also very friendly.

      Lux is SO bi-polar. Half the time the music is unbearable- industrial and LOUD and the service is little more than a grunt from the guy taking your order and your money. The other half of the time the music is Jazz and very conducive to drinking coffee and talking and seemingly more appropriate for the environment. Every once in a while there will be a semi-friendly face at the register, but not very often, in fact it is rare- I once made the mistake of ordering a small drink and they snarled at me that they "only pull double shots" which I had read only moments earlier on the menu but had already forgotten (mommy brain) but they definitely could have handled that a little more nicely. They have books and other kid entertainment so I know they WANT to be kid friendly but the loud industrial music has got to go. The coffee is good and the environment is cool. The pastries are heavenly. I would have only given them 2 stars but the owners are pretty cool and I have hope that they will become more consistent with the music and service. I haven't been there in  a while, mainly for fear of a bad experience but I will give it another chance. I hope they become less focused on being "cool" and more focused on giving customers a genuinely well rounded- good experience.

      I don't really do the whole "hang out at a coffeebar" type thing, so my review is based only on the drink itself, which has been awesome every time I've been there.    Best in the valley.   It's a shame Central is such a pain.

      I LOVE LUX! Each time I order my cafe latte or au lait, I sprinkle Sugar in the Raw over the creamy froth and then inhale the coffee goodness before I begin drinking.  I have never had a bad coffee experience at Lux and I have been there oh so very many times. But it is not only the coffee that is fantastic. Be sure to try the toast. That's some tasty goodness! The other pastries are delicious (especially the brioche), but I find them to be a bit too pricey for my student budget.   The only other issue I have with Lux is the outlet situation for laptops. There are very few and, especially on weekends, the coveted spots near the outlets are often taken. I guess you can look at it on the bright side- Take the time instead of working to people watch, enjoy the music or read a good book.

      Habitat of the rare Phoenix-hipster.  The coffee drinks are better than any other coffee shop I have found in Phoenix.  Not as good as SF or Portland...  but still pretty good.  Hipster scene aside, this is actually a very pleasant place to hang out.  It is a true coffee house.  Props for the Adler vase on the counter and mod decor.  If I am in the mood to drink coffee and catch up on some reading I will definitely come here.

      Mmm, Lux. Some of the best coffee in Phoenix. The interior is ever-changing as new artists are featured on its walls and the furniture is rearranged on a regular basis.   Beans are fresh roasted on the premises so you know it's fresh and not vacuum-sealed from some huge faceless corporation. (I think you know who you are...)  There is plenty of seating inside and out front under the covered awning. This comes in handy during the summer months for getting out of the sun, but does that really matter when it's 117 degrees? And why are you drinking hot coffee on a hot day like that? What would your friends say? I suppose you could always try it iced too...

      This coffee joint is great. The coffee is so good and so strong just one small one gets your buzz on. The baked goods baked IN HOUSE are soooooo delish. My cupcake was a bit dry once, but I kind of like them like that, however my friend I was with was a bit upset about the lack of moisture. They always have great zines to read and books to look at and tons of newspapers lying around. The seating is good, however they might want to rethink all of the white couches and chairs because they are super beat up. I think this place is the bee's knee's and you should go sip some java at this joint.

      Espresso, pastries and service is awesome! Building and location is great. Art and reading material is always fresh. The barrista's obscure music/noise being blasted at full volume? That's the main reason I get everything to go or sit outside and don't give them 5 stars.

      Skateboards as art, hanging on the walls. That's where my eyes landed first upon entry. Then I noticed the tables. Finally, the menu, including the tempting pies and sugary treats taunting me from the counter.   There was a short line but the pace was quick. I ordered a simple iced coffee with room (for cream). Cost was $2.50. It's all the cash I had on me at the time. Kismet. The  plastic cup, with a crooked Lux sticker, came nearly full. I braced for the staunch coffee jolt when sipping it down below the brim. But, to my surprise, no such jolt happened. Without cream, this iced coffee was great. That's all I needed to rate this place 4 stars. Seriously. Most coffees you have to "dumb down" to taste. Not here. So, I added cream and a couple of packs of organic sugar. I mixed. I grabbed a bright orange straw and managed to spill my coffee when trying to insert the straw into the lid. Oh joy. A handful of napkins later, I was good to go.   I parked myself outside under the canopy at one of their wooden tables. I sipped slowly, enjoying reprieve from the still-hot-in-November Phoenix sun. I enjoyed relaxing here, watching people come and go, watching the people inside work on their laptops. This is definitely a great place to hang out, to get some work done and to catch up with friends. I'll be back, especially now that I know the coffee is fantastic and it's within a short walk from my abode.   Praise Allah for Lux!

      What a cool little cafe, with a DJ playing early in the morning, delicious berry corn muffins, and good coffee. A little loud for my taste at that hour, but quite a popular little joint, and lots of regulars. Cool artwork on the walls. I was staying nearby for a few days, and for me, this was definitely the best part of this neighborhood.

      Things I like in a coffee house...  1. Oddly, not coffee. I really am not a coffee person which leads me to...  2. Tea. I like tea. Tea and me are friends and when the barrista/o knows just as much about his teas as he does his coffees, then I am always impressed.  3. FREE wifi. I've been traveling a lot lately and I never really appreciated the beauty of free wifi til recently. You get ripped off at hotels, airports, etc, so when a place like this doesn't charge you to chill and enjoy your time here while surfing for midget porn, then I am very grateful.  4. Good people watching. Let's face it. I observe people for a living. I don't technically get paid for this, but I do it and so, I require a nice amount of characters to check out. Last night offered a dude wearing sunglasses...at night, along with two gay guys on a first date. Always VERY entertaining to watch someone else's awkward encounter unfold. "So, where did you go to elementary school?" "I hate when coffee is too strong!" "yada yada yada." (PS, they left to go for a "walk" so maybe it did go well)  5. A cool bathroom. I know this may seem odd, but I love cool bathrooms and loathe gross ones. There is no middle ground for me. Sadly, Lux falls into the latter and it was guuross! The attempt at art is...interesting though, and by interesting I mean, not so much, but hey, at least it distracts you from looking around at the wet floor and paper towel explosions and dirty counters.  So how does Lux weigh in on my 5 list. I think at a solid 3.5. Overall, the atmosphere was a tad sterile for my taste. I generally prefer really cozy couches and warm tones and cool lighting instead of white walls and somewhat fluorescent lighting. But the white tea was damn tasty, so I gotta give it up for that :)

      Wow...I just found this little hidden gem here in CenPho. I'm sure no one's heard of it...hee hee... Lux is like the community center for the hipsters and thirsties. I don't know if I"m hip, but I do know sometimes I get thirsty. For some java. And thirsty for a non Starbucks place to hang. I think the loud DJ music kicks ass. What a great stamp to put on the ever so tiring hip coffee house scene still sprouting up across this great land. Funky art? Seen it. Eclectic rec room furniture. Sat on it. Tattooed and face- bejeweled employees? A must have. But the DJ? That's all Lux baby. My doctor has "suggested" (ok, like he totally insists) that a go easy on the caffeine. So one cup of this sturdy liquid beans keeps me going all day. Muffins and scones are great, especially if you get there real early. The Lux crew is friendly and efficient. It's so popular that navigating the small quarters at peak hours can be dicey. I know I've bumped a few end tables in my quest to get out and hear the slosh of a patron's coffee spilleth over. But, you know. Since I'm so hip, I just keep walking.

      Lux is, without a doubt, my favorite coffee shop in Arizona.  Their drinks are a perfect balance of well-roasted beans and milk, served in smaller European-style ceramic cups.  Both the small and medium have two shots; pick the small for an intense coffee flavor, or the medium if you like more milk.  I don't think Lux has flavored syrups, but their mocha and velvet add a wonderfully smooth chocolate base. So, my dear friends in Phoenix, enjoy your Lux because when you move you're not likely to find anything as good!

      This place is really ahead of its time. Unfortunately, it seems to be growing too big for itself. Every time I go inside there now I have to wait in a line for my drink and then there is never any seating unless you go outside. The staff is usually pretty cool depending on who you get. I love the design and layout. Great tea and coffee. Wireless internet as well!

      I come here every year to meet my good friend for coffee as it's between our folk's houses. i have many fond memories of jamming a years worth of events into 90 min conversations over tasty coffee and chai.  everyone who works here is awesome and the drinks are good. i never see a crowd but i go at fairly off hours - i could see it getting crowded as they have it set up more like a living / dining room than a restaurant.  my favorite place to sit is at the giant light table. can't wait for the next time i am back in AZ so i get to go back!
