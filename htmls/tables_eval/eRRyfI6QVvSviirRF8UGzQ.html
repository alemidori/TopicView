      I found myself wondering how they could possibly make anything more amazing and luxurious than the Wynn.    This place will blow your mind!  So stunning, more cohesively designed thank the original tower in my opinion.    so apparently this is the only place to go now...not to mention a ton of new places to dine and XS...  XS is the most stunning place EVER.  I am a huge fan of Tryst and the service they provide there.    Tryst had two problems: 1.not enough bathrooms 2.not enough stripper poles  They seriously solved the hell out of both of these problems!!!  Stripper poles disguised as very large chic light fixtures and more restroom stalls than Giant's Stadium.  The whole club is so stunning, no doubt it will be the number 1 spot in vegas.

      I spent some time at Encore on opening night.   CASINO: It's just like the Wynn, but with a slightly altered color scheme.  Too much red; I felt like I was walking around in a maraschino cherry. The ceilings are too low making it seem claustrophobic.  RESTAURANTS: The Cirque-y moving-walls at Switch will underwhelm you every 25 minutes. Didn't get in to Sinatra's cuz there was a private party.  Didn't get to Botero Steakhouse but it looks very appealing. Art helps with protein-digestion as far as I'm concerned.  There is no buffet: halleleujah!  XS was the one bright spot...a gorgeous venue! I predict this club will become the hottest destination in the club universe.  Until,of course, the next over-the-top, Rome-is-burning club opens.  Didn't see the rooms yet.  I heard the Spa is extraordinary.  The best thing about Encore is the same as the best thing about Wynn: the employees. They are the best-trained casino-workers anywhere. Frankly, it's worth going there just for them.

      The Encore is smaller in everything compared to the Wynn, with their own casino, villas, suites, restaurants, and bars/clubs.  I really wondered how the Encore would compare to the Wynn since Wynn is probably the best hotel/casino on the strip.  I was largely disappointed - by the casino decor.  The entire casino floor has these giant BRIGHT red chandeliers (I submitted photos) that really become nauseating after a couple minutes of looking at them.  Whoever picked this color was way in over their head and needs to go die.  The suites aren't really suites, just really large rooms, big enough for 6 people to sleep in comfortably (with two beds and couches), and possibly fit up to 12 people if half of your party is willing to sleep on the brand new floor, since there's a lot of open space (go look at my photos I submitted).  Large bathroom with his and her sinks and shower heads (2), though the removable one is sort of hard to grip.  We had an amazing view though (again, look my photos), since the rooms have floor to ceiling windows.  Overall, I don't think it's better than the Wynn, but it's definitely worth a stay, since the rooms are brand new and they have a completely different color scheme, decor, and vibe.  I guess really, I rate it a 3.5 :)  P.S.  Apparently no photography of the casinos allowed, 'cause when I was taking a photo of the disgusting chandeliers (again, photos), security came over and told me I couldn't take photos of the casino - which I thought was rude 'cause I was aiming my camera directly up at the chandelier.

      Gorgeous, Beautiful, Luxurious.  These words can not even begin to describe this new LV addition.  It is smaller than the Wynn but I love its intimate feel.  Even the restrooms are spectacular.  The tile floors had many many butterfly designs which made me a quick fan.  There is also a Botero restaurant in there that is absolutely beautiful ( I guess similar to the Picasso in Bellagio).  I loved all the red and was very impressed with the air in there.  It smelled of flowers and you do not smell cigarettes even though they are present.  The Asian fusion restaurant has the most beautiful dragon sculpture I've ever seen.  Oh how do I love thee...

      Before visiting Encore, I've talked to multiple dealers at other casinos and all they had to say about it was "It is very red."  And BOYY were they right.. Carpets were red.. Certain walls were red..Chandeliers were red...I thought the chandeliers looked a bit tacky though.. It almost looked a bit fake/cheap.. But it goes with the theme.. The front entrance was beautiful with their floral displays like the Wynn.  In general I thought Encore was going to be more grand and unique like the Wynn with their waterfalls but that wasn't the case.  I guess I expected too much out of Encore!  The casino Area and Lobby Hotel is definitely smaller than the Wynn.  I noticed there was a lot of bars around the casino area on the sides though which is a plus for many people.  There's a club at Encore called XS which opened on NYE.. Will check that place out next time i come back to Vegas!  Overall though, Encore is indeed nice but just not that what i expected it to be..   plus new casino with so much red color for luck... not so lucky for kathy and roulette that night... sigh!

      The most fabulous hotel in Vegas! The beau and I went for Xmas- just a few days before Encore's grand opening.   The rooms; very sexy, sleek, modern, exquisite! All rooms are suites.   Service - Fantastic!   I typically don't like Vegas but I can't wait to return to Encore!

      While this place was fabulous.. there are so many utterly fabulous resorts in Vegas that this place is far from being #1. The restaurants (ok so I only tried Switch) was a little disappointing.. and while the decor is cool, it's nothing ground breaking. The views are impeccable.. not sure if all the rooms are facing the strip southbound, but the ones that are... wow.. what a view! If I ever had a room here on NYE , I'd watch the fireworks in style from my suite.   Lucky for you, Yelp, I stayed in/stepped foot in an Encore room, a Palazzo room, and a Trump room all in a span of 36 hours so I can write you a very good comparison of the 3 luxury hotels of the north end. I will rank them in a few categories from best to worst  Room Size/Spacious feeling: Palazzo, Trump, Encore. Encore's wall divide thing creating 3 distinct rooms is fun, but the open sunken living room at Palazzo is hard to beat.   Decor: Encore, Trump, Palazzo. Encore was very cohesive.. which I like. It felt like stepping foot into a red/black/white modern art painting. My dad hated the "gaudy" Encore however, so keep in mind this place is very modern. Palazzo the more I look at it is poorly decorated... the drapes look like an ugly grandma comforter, and the burgundy tones next to the browns look kinda icky.   Bed: Trump, Encore, Palazzo. The bed at Trump ROCKS. Soooo comfy.  Bathroom: Trump, Palazzo, Encore. Encore sucked here... tiny bathtub.. WTF. A 5 star hotel should have a giant bathtub! The Trump bathtub with jets is incredible and huge.   Personally I'd choose Trump if prices were equal for all 3. The kitchenette is a nice bonus too! While Encore is nice, I don't feel like it's fun modern decor makes up for the cramped feeling suite or the subpar bathroom.

      Had Encore been it's own stand alone hotel, I would've given it 4 stars. But since it is the Wynn's sister hotel, I'm gonna be a little more critical. I had a back to back stay in the Encore and the Wynn so hopefully this will be helpful for future guests when deciding which hotel to stay at.  Design: Butterfly overload. I'm a fan of LV casino carpets and was personally impressed by the entrance way to the Wynn Theater (Steve Wynn's wife's favorite part of the Wynn). However, multiply that by 100 and you get a sensory overload. The casino feels crowded and overstuffed with low ceilings, large obtrusive pillars, and too much foliage! The color scheme is dark and primarily red (which is a great contrast to the Wynn's light creamy colors), but is horribly speckled with "the most disgusting and repulsive chandeliers ever". I'm disappointed in a lot of decor choices as the Wynn's design aspects are perfectly portioned, textured, and balanced and I would have expected the same (if not better) from Encore. For one thing, the connector from the Wynn to the Encore leads to a very uninteresting area--literally 5 feet away from a slot machine node. I would have expected a much more grand entrance way as the majority of traffic would being coming from the connector from the Wynn.   Casino: Poker room is over at the Wynn. Table games are alright but there are few people playing at Encore--most are over at the Wynn. Limits are the same at the Wynn ($15-500 min bet) I also thought the slot machine selection was whatevers. Give me my $2 max bet Wheel of Fortune please!!!  Rooms: The rooms are huge! Great black and cream color scheme. Our double suite came with a large overstuffed corner couch (which 2 normal sized adults can sleep on comfortably as we discovered). The bathtub is smaller than the Wynn, but the vanity is MUCH larger for some reason. There is a convenient master remote located on the nightstand that controls the curtains, lights, and privacy sign (no more need to leave the bed and put that darned sign on the bed!). The privacy button lights up the privacy sign outside and mutes the doorbell (yes, the Encore suites HAVE doorbells!) which is uber convenient. The beds, amenities, and some of the decor is exactly the same as the Wynn. You can either get the strip view (which we got) that overlooks not only the strip but also the Wynn AND the gorgeous golf course or the other side that overlooks looks, uh, that end of the strip. We ordered room service and the food was brought up quickly and the dining cart converted in a luxurious table spread! Oh, and the food wasn't bad either ;) Comfy and sleek room. A+  Service: Guest beware. All encore staff is NEW which translates to slower, bumbling service. Our room was not turned down after several of hours of leaving the "service room please" sign on the door. Checkout is strange. To prevent long queues, since the registration desk is incredibly small and at the other side of hotel, attendants greet you at the elevators to check you out. Not bad, but i see that as a flaw in the hotel that they would even need to offer that. Anyhoo, on our way out we went to go get our car and was told that there would be a minimum 15 minute wait. Alright, makes sense with the flood of guests from the grand opening. I chatted with other patrons who were waiting 30 minutes, 45 minutes, and HOUR??? Not only did the valet forget to turn in a few tickets, but they were rude and disrespectful to patrons who further inquired about their car. Blah, not good. But I guess they'll work out a few of the kinks as time progresses... I hope.  Overall, the Encore was interesting to look at and felt overwhelmingly like a poorly designed Wynn. The one, and the only, redeeming quality is the rooms. Amazing design and functionality. However, the bland casino, the repeating shops (it is really necessary to have 2 Chanel and LV boutiques in the same resort complex?), and the terrible design &amp; layout make this only a 3 star hotel for me. So stay at Encore for the rooms and go to the Wynn for everything else :)

      With a fresh and "South Beach" like atmosphere, the Encore is quite frankly the nicest, hippest and most comfortable hotel room I've ever stayed in.  If you like contemporary design then you'll appreciate Encore's decor and ammenities.  If your tastes are more on the classic style side then you'll probably enjoy Palazzo or Bellagio more.  I've stayed at almost every single 4 or 5 star hotel in Vegas and Encore shines above the rest.  I will be staying here exclusively from now on.

      This hotel steps it up a notch on quality and comfort.  I attended the 2008 CES show and was exceptionally impressed with the Encore hotel. While I will say not everything is the greatest it is a great overall experience.  The Wynn was record breaking when it first opened and now the Encore is here with a smaller, but comfy feeling casino.  The gounds were impeccable and I thought to myself we are in the desert so every tree, shrub, bush, flower, etc was hand planted and there were countless ones of all different sizes. Also, the feature Wynn and Encore share is the smaller registration/check in areas that make you feel more comfortable and not lost in grand central station. Staff were courteous, helpful, always smiling and just great overall.   My Hotel room - they are all suites and just beautiful.  The decor is simple contemporary and not overly modern. I love the layout.  You step in to the foyer and their is a large bathroom on the right - inside is a stall shower and normal size bathtub (which is the weakness), a separate toilet room with door, 2 marble sinks and counter with big mirror, marble floor. Once you go past the bathroom there were closets on the right and 3 large mirrors on the left.  Then you walk into the bedroom which is decent size with a luxurious, comfortable bed.  There is a open wall that divides the room from the stepped down living room complete with floor to ceiling windows.  The open wall had the large LCD TV that swiveled 360 so you can watch it in bed or on the the L shaped couch in the living room.  The living room also had a nice desk with all the amenities including a fully network digital phone that was simple to use. There is also the famous mini bar that is great for late night raiding. To top it all off, there were controls on the nightstand by the bed that controlled all the lights, sheer drapes, curtains, etc by the push of a button.  That was great!  I will be back to this place, no doubt!

      Just spend the weekend at Encore and within 2 mins of arrival, the HORRIBLE service started. I got an email invite with a special rate directly from them as a Red Card Member. My reservation was booked at least 3 weeks in advance over their reservation line since that was the only way I can get the deal. The agent on the line asked me if I wanted 2 Queens and I replied with a "Yes."   Problem 1: Check in time, reservations they have in system is for 1 King bed and for 1 person.   Problem 2: they DID NOT have ANY rooms available. How is that possible when I made a reservation 3 weeks prior?!?!   Problem 3: they were going to send me to Wynn for a King bed room  Problem 4: I will be paying the SAME rate as for Encore. (Deal was Encore $159/night &amp; Wynn $139/night)  My bro refused to be sent to Wynn and asked to speak with the manager. Manager replied "we can have house keeping to check if there are any free rooms." The first guy guys just told me they DID NOT have any rooms based on their system. 3 mins later manager said "Ok, we found a room with a King bed that we can put you in IMMEDIATELY." How did they suddenly "found" a free room when their system said they were completely booked?!?!  Problem 5: Check out. System check out on the TV does not work.   Problem 6: Called front desk to check out. They were going to charge me close to $1,000 for 2 night stay? Ok turns out girl was reading the wrong room which happens to have the same last name. And she sounded extremely confuse with what she was doing.  I will stay away from Encore until they clean up their act. Their rooms however are very nice and comfortable. With the exception of their customer service, I would probably stay here again.

      I usually stay at the Wynn (especially after finding out that Sheldon Adelson, owner of the Venetian / Sands, is a right-wing nutjob), but gave Encore a try this past weekend.  Some kinks in the check-in process - they were very full because of CES and the adult film convention, but eventually got a resort room with two queen beds on the 18th with a decent Strip view.  Front desk lady told me that all rooms with two beds face the Strip.  The room is beautiful, much nicer than the rooms at the Wynn, and not just because it's newer. There's a bit of an Asian motif with lacquered wood paneling on the walls, the beds are larger, the couch in the corner is a nice touch (not as comfortable as the ones in the Venetian suites), and the complimentary water bottles were much-appreciated.  A little further from the Wynn than I would like, and the hallway around XS late on a weekend night is crowded. Other than that, no complaints - it's the luxury one would expect from the Wynn, but turned up a notch.

      I was so impressed by the decor of this Hotel it gave me a big smile! I'm so tired of boring, drab decor and finally a Hotel does something out of the ordinary with their decoration. Hooray!!   I loved it! The bright red wake-up chandeliers, the beauiful large bright red flower pieces on the walls, the butterflies in the marble, the trees inside....it's a hotel I think my friends would also love! (I went with my fiance...(he was happy that I liked it so much.)  The food in the cafe was delicious and I did enjoy the decor there too. :)

      My friends and I stayed there this past weekend... so I'll start with the bad because that's more fun...   When we were making the reservation, we got a deal to get a suite with 2 queen beds. She verified with the person on the phone that we'd get 2 queen beds because on the website it says they only have suites with a king bed. My friend gets there, checks in and of course there aren't any rooms with 2 queen beds. The good thing is after complaining we got a roll away cot that was actually pretty comfortable.   Being such a new hotel, I think the staff is slightly inexperienced. My friend had added my name to the room because I was arriving at a different time and at first the person at the front desk couldn't find my name on the reservation and after a minute or so was like oh I looked in the wrong place... uhhhh ok? Then when directing us to the elevator to get to our room, we got the wrong directions and ended up somewhere else...   The location is only ok. It's all the way at the end of the strip so it's not as easy to get around but if the weather isn't bad, that's not too much of an issue.  It is close enough to TI, Wynn and Venetian that if you usually only stay around that area than it's no biggie.  Also it's right across from this large mall so there is plenty of shopping.   Ok so the good...   The room is really nice and up to what I expected. It was nice to have the drapes open and close right by the bedside. The bathroom is great and being a new hotel, you can tell the towels, sheets etc. are all crisp and clean.   A big plus was that we had left our curling iron on in the room. We called the hotel and they helped us go into the room and turn it off.  I know it benefits them more than me because if their hotel burnt down after opening for 3 weeks would be a disaster but it was still nice of them to do it.  So overall the staff is very friendly and they try to be helpful.  Checking out was also very easy.  As soon as we came down the elevators, they had 2 people waiting to check your name off and that was it. Check out down.  Fast and easy.  We didn't have to return any keys because they print your name on them which I thought was kind of cool.  And other random comments...  So this hotel is definitely geared towards an Asian clientele (and more specifically chinese) because the red from the hotel was overwhelming. Also floor 40-49 is missing.   The casino seemed kind of empty for a vegas hotel. During the day, the bj tables were around $10 even though it was Sat. At night I think you could find tables for $15.

      My gf and I have stayed at Bellagio and now Encore within 6 months. With that in mind, I think it's very fair to compare the two. Just got home last night from a 4 day/3night stay at Encore and I can't rave enough about this hotel. First off, YOU GOTTA LOVE RED  and Asian art if you are even going to step foot in Encore. It comes off as a high-end European hotel with MAJOR eastern influeneces. The casino is considerably smaller than Wynn and feels like it too, much more comfortable without the high empty ceilings and wide open spaces. The slots were pretty loose and tables were cheaper in the daytime (but that's stardard practice). The walk to and from Wynn was not that bad...it takes 5 minutes walking at a slow pace, unless you're walking through when XS is open. Then it takes a few more seconds to make your way through the masses.  On to the rooms, loved the room it self far better than a Tower Deluxe King, but the view from Bellagio (and the bathtub) was better. That's the only thing, though. As we entertained a couple of friends who live in Vegas, it was great to have the seperate sitting room.  The bed was amazingly soft and the Egyptian linens were very nice, almost as nice as the slippers and chocolate from turndown service. I have to agree with the comments about this place being romantic, but it does help when you're there during AVN/AEE weekend (oh and that other show in town, CES). Checkout was a little weird, the express checkout still doesn't work yet, also the recent cold spell before X-mas knocked out the heating coils in the pool (who wants to swim in January though), but those were the only times that I witnessed any flaw in how the the hotel operates, one of which was completely out of their control. The staff were incredible, always making sure that we have everything you need and that you are enjoying yourself. OK, so to compare Bellagio and Encore: I loved Bellagio, for it is a great resort in a great location in Vegas. Encore though is taking the best of the Pacific Rim and put it into the Ritz-Carlton. Would I recommend this resort/hotel...absolutely with the utmost of enthusiasm.

      The Hotel in itself is beautiful. I love the red chandlers. It has a very new age burlesque feel to it.    The rooms were nice with an awesome view, but not that much different from the Wynn. The major difference was the use of textures. Everywhere! I loved the imitation crocodile on the walls of the elevators.   I met one friendly bartender at the East side bar, I forgot her name. And there was a blonde cocktail waitress at the restaurant/lounge by the elevators, I think her name was Shantal or something close to that. Those girls were awesome! So helpful, fun to talk to and really earned their tips.   That is where the good review stops.   The Sushi restaurant inside was good, but not worth the wait.  It took over an hour for sushi! And it was not even that busy.  The water glasses are tiny and you have to keep asking for more water!  Hello its Vegas, pretty much everyone is hung over and needs water!  The service as a whole in the casino was slow.   House keeping had not even made it to our room by 6 pm!   Maybe after being open for a few more months the staff will get the hang of things, but for now I would just stay at the Wynn and walk to Encore!

      I have been to over 10+ Vegas hotels and this one by far is the best.  All workers(dealers, front desk clerk, bell boy) are all refreshed and very nice.  Everything is new and very open.  I don't remember it being smokey at all either.  Price is not so friendly (room service for two came out to $100) and simple nuts in the room can cost ~$8, etc.  Hotel Rooms - I feel the space at Venetian was better, but every part of the room will get you staring.  The bed sheets, the lamp, the wall is different everywhere, tv is actual brand name (sharp), the naked painting in the bathroom, etc.  It's a very very nice room.  Casino - surprisingly the limits here are the same as Harrahs (mostly $10-$25 limit).  The drinks they serve here are the best in the whole strip so make sure you order yourself a drink here.  I even ordered water and they gave me a Fiji bottle.  Service - The front desk through us at the top floor with a room upgrade (panoramic view).  So make sure you chat it up with the front desk and just ask for it :)  This is the first place where I had baggage claim flag a taxi and placed the bags in the taxi for us.  The first place where I felt a tip was actually deserved.  Any Negative Points?  - If anything, I felt the casino was a bit small so you should walk on over to the Wynn if everything is full.

      The hotel and rooms are beautiful but that simply does not excuse the worst service ever! We checked in at 3pm and didn't get our 3 rooms until 6pm. We made our reservation a month ago, asked for non smoking and 2 beds. We got smoking and 1 bed. To make it better, the registration desk girl was the biggest bitch ever. She said "a request is just a request," we never promised anything. No apology, just attitude!!  At 7pm the other half of our party checked in (couples) and they got 2 beds each. They were told that is all that is available.  WORST service ever!!!!

      I attended the opening ceremony and opening night of Encore. The crowd waiting to enter encore at 8 PM for the grand unveiling was in a festive mood. The crowd was festive even though the line to get in snaked through the entire Wynn. The mood began to dimish as 8:15, 8:30, 8:45, 9PM started to roll around and the line had moved a grand total of 45 feet. The employees of the Wynn spent the entire day promoting the 8PM start and invitation to experience the new hotel an casino. Then they treated it like entrance to Tryst.  Opening the line a few "guests" at a time so as to not impeded on the "total experience" of the Encore for all the others.  Please - - - it is another huge addition to the Vegas strip and there was nothing magical to it.......... The hotel is pleasing, the casino is very similar (obviously) to the Wynn-although there is a touch more red in the decor and the experience should be wonderful once the staff is on the par with the Wynn.  I do not think, as a whole,  there is an entire staff that can match the quality of the people that work in the Wynn. Encore will get there .........  the place looks great. Soon the quality of the staff will catch up as well.  By the way ...... The casino was very enjoyable about 2 AM on opening night ( or morning).

      Steve Wynn has done it again. As the latest addition to the Wynn family of luxury resorts, Encore is superb. The all suite hotel delivers unparalleled service and amenities that any true connoisseur would be proud of. My first experience with Encore began with a Rolls Royce ride from the airport.  his ride was not only a metaphor for the grandeur I was about to experience, but was also the perfect way to keep me in the ample luxury that I am used to.  Upon entering Encore you are quickly inundated with beautifully colored mosaic butterflies along every pathway and the liberal use of rouge in the carpet and exquisite chandeliers. Natural sunlight brings warmth and energy to the gaming floor, while flowers and plants leave wafts of their wonderful aromas dangling in the air. Every detail, from wallpaper to door handles has been carefully scrutinized for perfection by interior designer Roger Thomas and it shows. The intimate feel of Encore lends cache to every activity that you can do.  Unlike other places in Las Vegas, Encore is not overburdened with tourists and the common gentry.  The suites at Encore only further enhance the wonderful experience. With automatic drapes, glass enclosed showers, and flat panel televisions, it is hard to leave your room for anything else! The view from my room looked out upon the Las Vegas strip and all its glitz and glamour. As I write this entry I can only wish that I was back in my suite, getting ready for some gambling. Better yet, I wish I was at the spa.  Located on the second floor of Encore, the spa features 37 treatment rooms, 14 naturally-lit garden rooms and four oversized couples' suites for massage, body treatments and facials. Then there are two movement studios offering spinning, yoga, pilates, conditioning and meditation classes as part of the new Fitness Center. With such a vast array of services in a tranquil atmosphere the spa will definitely make you forget your bad luck at the blackjack table.  Encore is definitely the place to stay in Las Vegas if only the finest will do! Keep checking back, as I will go into more details of the fine and not so fine restaurants and nightclubs at Encore. Now if only I can only come up with reason to ask Steve to let me come back again.

      Should there be a finer experience in Vegas, in terms of true luxury that, at the minute (since the table's have turned and Vegas is the one loosing it's a**), is affordable to us masses, I don't know of it. Yes, there are a myriad of fancy suites available to those who will pay or who gamble enormous sums, but for most, a standard "deluxe" room - though they're usually quite nice- is the way we roll. For now, at least, the Encore is offering such excellent rates (we got the weekend of a huge conference for $139/nt) that it's beyond anything else I've experienced. The hotel itself is richly decorated in reds, black, golds. Everything is sumptuous yet, somehow, classy. It's airy, much more so than the Wynn or Bellagio, and has stunning, though understated, grounds. The casino isn't large, but I didn't have trouble finding penny machines, $10 blackjack tables, and even a few other lower-priced games. The rooms, which are all suites, were more luxe than the Wynn with large comfortable beds, modern decor, a second room, two flat-screen televisions, an actually comfortable and classic couch and daybed as well as the remote control curtains that are key for overcoming a Vegas morning after. The bathrooms are large and well-appointed, with soft, large robes, marble countertops and floors and a large, welll kept bathtub. The whole operation is run by extremely helpful and friendly, though not saccharine, employees. Drink service is excellent too. The only thing that keeps me from rating this 5 starts is the distance from everything else. Now, I realize that it's not something that can be improved, but potential guests should be aware that it's quite a bit further than even the Wynn, and it's a good 20, 25 minutes at least to old TI.

      I don't even know where to start...I was very excited to come to Las Vegas to see the new Encore....We checked in at 3pm and didn't get our room till 5ish. so when i got to our room first i found out i got one king bed, when i clearly requested for two queens a month ago, and i also reminded them when i was there. i went downstairs to see what was going on an they told me there will be no more queens beds the whole week that i am going to be here for. so i was like so i book 1month ahead of time saying that i wanted to queen n i get 1 king bed. what the hell is that all about. although i know my room was free but i did have to pay for one night for it. she told me in her system that  it  show only have one paying adult on there not four. but i clearly said i wanted two queens bed so wouldn't that mean anything. To make it better, the registration desk girl was the biggest bitch ever. She said "a request is just a request," we never promised anything. No apology, just attitude!! At 7pm the other half of our party checked in (couples) and they got 2 beds each. T  read more »hey were told that is all that is available. i was so piss that i was like forget it i am done with this place.   if you want to read more go Read Jen j. &amp; Maria j we were all there

      nice nice nice, especially for the cheap price we paid. our room was huge! and yes, everyone has talked about the red... it's true. but cmon, what do you expect in vegas, some classy decor?   oh, and guess what: they have flat screen tv's with actual hd service!! woo hdmi cables! a few little things to mention/complain about: the light went out in our closet. they never gave us more tissues after we ran out. and the biggest complaint: no fan in the bathroom to do your bidness!

      Being that I'm from SoCal, I've had my share of visits to the sin city.  This time around I had actually booked at the Wynn two weeks prior to my stay.  When we arrived on 1/16, we were "upgraded" to the Encore free of charge. Bottom line, the service was great, the buffet was terrific, XS was amazing and the room was perfect!   Hands down, best Las Vegas experience ever!!!

      very nice casino, new place to be seen. we arrived on 1/22/09 to gamble away after a day's worth of conference stuff only to learn that the table we were at had just opened (grand opening)! its reassuring to know that I'm probably the first sucker to lose money at table 5421! it only took three double gin and tonics to wipe me out. anyways, drink servers are awesome and they certainly keep up! overall the casino is very nicely done, everything has been meticulously taken care of. Now if I can only figure out how to walk out with money instead of making deposits...

      A weeks ago, my flight into Vegas was delayed for over 3 hours. By the time I got to the Wynn, the room type that I had booked was sold out. Erin from the front desk sent me over to a nice room at the Encore, a connected and adjacent property. It was a great little suite. The linens and the furniture were all top notch. All of my colleagues who had gotten rooms at the Wynn were impressed with the room at the Encore. Thanks Erin.  The overall level of service was high. The staff, from the front desk receptionist, to the servers, to the bartenders (Heather at the Parasol Bar), were all friendly and helpful. I was just killing some time playing low stakes roulette and ordered a White Russian. The drink came back in minutes and it was no different than the drink I ordered at the Parasol Bar the night before.    http://www.bluewaikiki.com/bw_lasvegas.html

      Red Chandeliers!    A Sinatra restaurant!    A Botero restuarant!    Botero is that Columbian artist who does full bodied, voluptuous statues like this:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botero  It's much more like what real people, especially modern people, look like, than say Michelangelo's David - which of course is showcased at Caesars.      And the Wynn/Encore is much more what modern people prefer than Caesars these days, which I suppose is the broader message.
