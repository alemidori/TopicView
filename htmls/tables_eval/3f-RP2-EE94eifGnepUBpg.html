      Today is the actual launch of the show, which is a tribute to the artistry of Cirque du Soleil and the magical music of The Beatles.  Check out their website for details and booking.  We went to the preview show in mid-June because I love the Beatles and was also impressed by the 25% discount on tickets.....  The costumes are exquisite, certainly flights of fancy and color, and the acrobatics and choreography to music that really means something (to me) made this a wonderful experience.  The show is not as "circus-y" as the others, like Mystere, but the rest compensates you for it, if you happen to even notice this point.  Without giving too much away, Yellow Submarine and Blackbird were my favorites, although the opening groovy dancing was so cool...I seriously thought Austin Powers was going to leap out at any moment.  The theatre is rather cosy so you still get value from sitting in the nosebleed section (Balcony, but Upper Orchestra might be optimal) as you can take in all the visual stimulation from up there...and I mean ALL, as there are fabulous things in the air, film projections on the walls and the pervasive voices of John, Paul, George and Ringo.  We sat in the Lower Orchestra and the benefit is that the performers can see you - I swear they were looking straight at us most of the time!  And we could closely examine their tattoos, armpits, muscular legs, arms, etc. and any other area you wish to ogle.  The nostalgia of having bought my very first record, which was a Beatles record of course, shook me up but it was simply a very happy experience.   Folks of all ages seemed to be having a good time, though kids are not permitted to the show (under the age of 5), but I think you'd want to take kids over 10 to really get value of spending that kind of money on the ticket.  I agree with the website marketing of the show:  the listener is immersed in the world of the Beatles.  Don't forget to take someone that YOU love!

      LOVE is all you need.  Seriously.  This was my first Cirque show and I enjoyed every moment.  The music was fantastic and I particularly loved hearing clips from The Beatles messing around in the studio when they were young.  The dancing and acrobatics were entertaining, although one of the stunts made me uncomfortably nervous.  I have heard from most that there are fewer acrobatics that the other Cirque shows, but don't let that keep you away.  If you are at all a Beatles fan, this show is fun and entertaining.  There are moments where the dancing is a little boring, but all in all, two thumbs up.  The skaters, the music, the costumes and the cirque people were all fantastic.  I would see it again!

      Was it a Cirque du Soleil or a musical?  Was I there to enjoy true Cirque magic as in Mystere' or O?  For sure not.  Was I there to enjoy live music as in Mama Mia?  Well, no.  I was VERY disappointed with this show.  It didn't know what it was supposed to be - sure it had some nice lighting effects and the music, well, it was the Beatles, but other than that, this was a real bummer.  I'd see Mama Mia, or Celine 10x again and again, or Mystere' or O, but this thing, I'd hand my ticket to one of the guys on the street handing out porno cards.

      This performance moved me. Going in not as a huge Beatles fan and never having been to a Cirque show I didn't have high expectations. The score and sound system were incredible. The visuals beautiful and delightful. My favorites were Octopus's Garden and Strawberry Fields. I loved everything about this show. I think being in the 3rd row made a difference too. It was like being part of the show. I am in love with LOVE and will go back EVERY time I am in Vegas. Kudos!

      We were there for the 7:30 Dec. 30 showing  and the show itself was awesome.  But through no fault of the performers; there was an hour long interruption caused by technical or mechanical difficulties at the beginning of the show.   For some reason the center staged got jammed and would not go down.  The bummer part was the general manager of the show came out after a few minutes and made an announcement saying the technicians should be finished fixing the problem in about 5 to 8 minutes...........which actually took an hour.  He should have offered free drinks or something for the inconvenience....since we missed our dinner reservation!    But overall, the show was spectacular....yes, this is one of the best cirque du Soleil show I have seen!

      It's really difficult to explain all that is to be seen &amp; felt at this show, but I will say it is one of the best shows of any genre I've ever seen.  Entertaining and touching and gorgeously directed, it's the kind of show that you'll appreciate regardless of your level of Beatle-ness or love of their music.  What I think this show does best is highlight just how iconic the Beatles truly are, and how enduring their music is and will continue to be.  I was wary of the "re-mastered like you've never heard them before" tagline of the show, but the sound was one of the most impressive parts of "Love".  The music of the Beatles comes out crisp and clear in full technicolor and from every angle.... it was sincerely awesome.    Funny, too, how a song you've heard a hundred times before can suddenly resonate a little bit deeper when heard in a new, fresh context.  When "Yesterday" qued up and the actors slowly floated around the stage in time to the music, I was surprised to find myself getting a little choked up.  To this day there isn't a musician or group in the world who will ever hold a candle to the Beatles.   A beautiful, entertaining and innovative show that I hope becomes another stage classic.  Absolutely do not miss it if you're in Vegas!

      Cirque du Soleil creates another amazing and fun show.  Using music from the Beatles, you can't help but walk out of the show feeling good.  You'll get standing up cheering and applauding the performers by the end of the show.    The interesting thing is, Love isn't so heavily dependent on acrobatics as the other Cirque shows.  This one focuses more on various styles of dance along with what I can only describe as aerial dance/acrobatics.  You still can't help but be amazed by what these performers can do.  As with most Cirque du Soleil shows, don't worry about the front row seats.  Sitting further back will give you a better vantage point to see everything going on on statge.

      I was a little worried about sitting too far since I wasn't in the lowest section, but when we got there I realized it was the perfect location. Not too close or too far from stage. Actually all the seats seem like a good location.   What I liked about this Cirque du Soleil show more than others is that it's a tribute to the Beatles. People can relate to the Beatles, so it was a delight when certain songs came on and I'd hear people around me singing, humming, or clapping along. It's very interactive in that sense. The performances and effects were mesmorizing. I had a soft spot for the lonely clown, who also came out to entertain us before the show started.    This show was all about having fun. It's the most light hearted Cirque du Soleil show I've seen.

      This was my first Cirque show ever, and it was AWESOME! Apparently there isn't as much acrobatics as there are in other shows, but nevertheless it was fantastic.  It seems like all the seats in the house were pretty good. Also, definitely don't forget to buy a $13 margarita, they're actually pretty good and come in a sweet plastic souvenir cup!   You can't beat the soundtrack, I definitely got caught singing along, much to the annoyance of my neighbors, who roughly elbowed me promptly.  Great show, and check out the Beatles themed bar outside the arena for a flashback to the '60's, or, if you're too young, like myself, a flashback to the last time you watched Austin Powers.

      I am a HUGE Beatles fan. I know everything about them. I looked forward to seeing the show. I wasn't disappointed but I'm such a Beatles purist that I expected more tie-ins between the music and the theatrical aspects of the show. Maybe I'm not so educated on Cirque and their whole "thing" but it was a pretty abstract show but with very impressive dancing, special effects and props. At certain points, I would just shut my eyes and listen to the remastered music and marvel at how good it sounded from the CDs I have at home.  I wouldn't see it again but it was worth seeing. It seems like a popular show. I saw it on a Monday night and the place was packed with excited people. It's great to see so many generations of Beatles fans.

      Bought a pair of tickets for my parents and thought it would be great since there's so much rave and it's from their generation.  They said it was quite interesting and some surprises, but only OK.  I think my mom enjoyed the surprises and my dad liked the surround sound music, especially that they have speakers installed in the seats.  But it gets sold out fast, so better book early because I couldn't get tickets the day of.  But that was like a almost a yr ago.  They also said that it was true you can get a good view basically anywhere you sit, (so no need to pay for the really expensive ones).  vegas baby!                                                                                  -Janice

      Went to see love recently. Wow what a treat. At first there is so much going on that you get sensory overload. But after you adjust its just sit back and enjoy the show. The sets are amazing, the costumes are awesome and the music is incredible especially if you are a Beatles fan. It is very different than most Cirque shows as the focus is on the music of the Fab Four and not so much on acrobatics or contortionist, but it is special none the less.

      I LOVED IT!  The music was fantastic, and it is fun to sing along.  Definitely go see it!  It's less heavy on the acrobatics, but the combination of the music and the choreography is amazing and highly entertaining!

      I've seen several Cirque du Soleil shows in the past:   Mystere at the Treasure Island, Corteo in San Francisco, and Zumanity at New York New York.   Without calling myself an habitue, I certainly know enough about the Cirque du Soleil to know what to expect.  Until now, that is.    Even though this does have some elements of the Cirque du Soleil, acrobatics don't feature as heavily in Love.  Nevertheless, the show was stunning and fabulous and the set design eclipsed anything I've seen until now.  Set to The Beatles' Love soundtrack by George &amp; Giles, the show is immensely entertaining.    I haven't really touched hallucinogenic drugs in 15 years and yet, this show seriously made me long for some lysergic acid diethylamide or some mushroom caps.  Anything, really, to accompany the sensory overload of colors, music, touch...Cirque du Soleil did a fabulous job and this show was by far my favorite (albeit not the most amazing) Cirque show I've seen!  Oh, and the acrobatic hippies bouncing up and down during "Revolution" had me laughing my ass off...   Look, I lived in Berkeley between 89 and 93, and the most exercise most hippies get is reaching for the bong, ok?   These guys were doing flips on and off the phone booth... HILARIOUS!  If you love beautiful set designs and enjoy the Beatles music, you're gonna love it!  I promise!

      This was my first Vegas show, and I LOVED IT!!!!!  This show was absolutely amazing! The acrobats and dancing and showmanship/entertainment was great!  I thought it was kind of funny that they had photographers walking around the audience taking photos of you there so you could purchase after the show.  Anyway, I'm not a huge Beatles music fan, meaning that I like their music, but I'm not fall down in love with it, but again, I LOVED IT! If your a Beatles music hater, then you might want to skip it, because of the people I know, the ones who really dislike Beatles music and only went because their significant other wanted to see it are the ones who hated it.

      All you need is LOVE!  When in Las Vegas, you must see this show!  I didn't think anything could ever top O, but somehow LOVE just blew it out of the water.  LOVE seemed to be more modern dance-oriented than circus-oriented, while also incorporating some great video footage.  The music took me to a happy, nostalgic, and euphoric place - marijuana not necessary!  I loved all the characters.  I want to see it again and again, and share it with everyone.  If John Lennon could see LOVE, he would be so proud.      Note: I would not recommend it for young children.

      Beyond my expectations of a Vegas show! Amazing, overwhelming display of creativity, choreography, artistry, sound and visuals. Everything. Every seat had speakers built in. Even our quasi-nosebleed seats were well worth it. Extremely helpful pages to show you around and easy to find the seats. I only recommend you buy your tickets online in advance and plan your trip around it.

      The hands-down greatest rock band of all time combined with Cirque? Are you kidding me?? I was so excited to see this show I almost peed my pants. My gf got us tix to see it for Valentines Day (I know, awww) and the first 20 minutes of the show was all I expected and more. Dreamy sequences with hints of characters from the songs I grew up listening to..it was amazing. I sung along with every track and darted my eyes around the stage so I wouldn't miss anything. I bought the soundtrack before seeing the show so I sort of knew what to expect music wise (awesome soundtrack btw; remixing the Beatles is like sacrilege but not in this case).  The only problem was that 20 minutes in, some jackass pulled the fire alarm...and the show grinded...to....a.....halt. The fire sprinklers over one of the sections starting going off, so they had to evacuate everyone. Unfortunately we never got to see the rest of the show, but we got a refund and were comped a meal and VIP seating after I called and bitched. Those 20 minutes sure were spectacular though.  *** Update 12/18/07: We finally made it back to see this show again. The whole time we were praying another fire alarm wouldn't go off, and we actually made it thru the whole show! LOVEd it, wouldn't change a thing. Not as acrobatic as the other Cirque shows from what I've heard, but the visuals combined with the timeless tracks is pure gold. Big ups to whoever did the motion graphics on the screens as well.

      The newest in the Cirque de Soleil empire, this show is based on the music of The Beatles.  If you want acrobatics and humor, see Mystere.  If you want great acrobatics with a watery theme, see O (or Le Rve).  If you want acrobatics and great technical feats, see K.  If you love Beatles music, see Love.  I enjoyed Love because I like Beatles music.  Yes, there are some pretty interesting acrobatics, but the heart of the show is the music.  The theater has an excellent sound system, and the choreography does a good job of supporting the music.  Hint: the seats closest to the stage are so close that it can be difficult to take in some of the acrobatics.  I sat in front and enjoyed it a lot, but the seats about 6 or 7 rows back are probably better.

      I've seen a lot of Cirque du Soleil shows, and I think after O, this is my second favorite.  Of course, the main draw to this show is the music of the Beatles.  Most of the tracks are taken directly from the Beatles' albums and played as a backdrop to a Cirque du Soleil show that was less Cirque, and more of a visualization of the Beatles' style, cultural impact, and art.  There are roughly four performers who serve as caricatures of the Beatles, and it was evident that several sequences mirrored the lives of the Fab Four.  A lot of the acts did more to tell a story rather than showcase a skill, which I thought kept the show together as one coherent piece.  And although I'm not big fan, some of the interpretive dance sequences were truly memorable.  The 360 degree stage was also interesting, and while it seemed during some scenes a little too big for what was going on on stage, most of the audience a central view of the action.  The wide movie theater style screens behind the back rows added visualization effects and depth.  On the way out, I noticed several people exiting the theater still singing Beatles tunes.  But whether you're familiar with the Beatles' or not, you're sure to leave entertained.

      Transcendent.  I love the Beatles, which was pretty much the only motivation for me to see a Cirque show or go to Las Vegas, where I hadn't been in at least eight or nine years.  It took Tita and I from February until June to finally confirm a weekend where we were both available and could commit to flying up to see the show. I bought the tickets only a couple of weeks ago, $165 each for fourth-row seats. TOTALLY WORTH IT. The performers were at eye-level, plus every seat had speakers on the front and back of the headrest, so the sound was incredible.  The song choices, as well as the costumes, choreography, and screened images that went along with them, were completely flawless. My favorite portions of the performance were probably the blinding beauty of the sun made of electric candles during "Here Comes the Sun," the twinkling lights and dizzying imagery during "Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,"  the skating act during "Help!" and of course, the lushness, vitality, and sheer beauty of the final number, "All You Need is Love."  Honestly, I was transported. There were times I wanted to cry because it was so overwhelmingly lovely, and times I just laughed and clapped with happiness because it was so absolutely perfect.  One word: GO.

      AMAZING.  This place is just purely AMAZING.  I dropped a pretty penny for some decent seats a few months after it opened.  I am a cheapskate and would normally would never drop this amount of dough on one night of entertainment, but this was oh-so-worth-it.  For months (years to come?) I can't help but keep reliving in my head the memories of this wonderful performance that marries the imagination and the love of Beatles perfectly into one show.  I have never seen anything like this.  I've seen Cirque du Soleil shows previously but nothing like this.  Nothing.  Come see it.  Live it.  I know I sound corny and I am not even a huge Beatles fan before I see this, but now I totally am.  All you need, is love.

      After having seen 10 different Cirque shows, I expected...oh, I don't know....Cirque? Instead, I got an interpretive dance show with (admittedly great) Beatles music. Only two real "Cirque" acts; the rest was almost two hours of interpretive dance and floorshow. Not what I have come to expect from the folks who did Mystere and Zumanity.  The remixed Beatles songs were phenomenal, as were the outtakes that were scripted to shadow performers acting it out. However, there were so many areas this show failed. Lady Madonna ended up being a modern African dance number with pregnant women. Here Comes The Sun was completely out of sync: the choreography had nothing to do with the music (music moved fast, they moved slow, etc.). I mean, the list goes on and on.  One note: if you have to go, get the upper balcony seats. Yes, they are less expensive, but you will actually get to see the action without a crick in your neck. Not to mention there is one "number" where the entire lower seats are covered with a sheet for over 2 minutes.   See if you can get a deal on the tickets; the prices are in no way justified for what you are seeing, unless you want to see Beatles-inspired dance number with 2 cool acts for less than 5 minutes each sprinkled in.

      Love this show, love this show, love this show.  Having seen Mystere last, was quite done with Cirque de Soleil for awhile.  But this was incredible.    Admittedly, I am a huge Beatles fan which is the only reason I was willing to sit through another Cirque show.  But my husband is not such a huge fan (knows some songs...can take them or leave them) AND he hated Mystere as well.  So getting him to pony up for the good seats to this was a miracle!  We were at eye level and those seats were worth every penny.  And we both walked away thinking that was one of the best shows we had ever seen.    The fusion of the music and the dance was great. For those few who complain it wasn't Cirque'y enough - I say yay.  It had just enough funkyness to it plus just the pure talent of the acrobatics and dance to keep your eyes glued to everything you possibly could take in.    I say if you can possibly see this show - do it!  I would go back in a heartbeat for a second show!

      Wow!!!  The Beatles have been such a powerful force in our culture that even if you lie to yourself and say you don't like the Beatles you do.  The song "yesterday" set to a visual orgasm is emotive to say the least.  I believe that this  is my favorite Cirque du Soleil.  I have seen them all with the exception of KA and I think I will stop here.  I don't want to ruin it for the rest.  Also, if what I hear materializes, and Criss Angel or whatever his name is becomes even closely related to the Cirque then its curtains.    Shame on you Cirque you have lost your identity.

      This is a brilliant show that I'll remember for a very long time, with the help of the soundtrack, no doubt. Each number had such sonic and visual originality, it can be hard to process, so I'm sure the second time around is even better.  I've never seen a Cirque show, so I can't compare it against anything else.  I'm not sure how this shows plays to non-Beatles fans, but I think most people will have at least a pleasant association with about 2/3 of the songs.  I really like the Beatles and knew all the songs, but I'm not a Beatles nerd who can identify all the bits they intersperse throughout the show. If that describes you, there is plenty here to listen for.  The sound is incredible and the theater is beautiful- check it out for sure.

      Having seen all but one of Cirque Du Soleil's "resident" shows (Myste`re (twice), O, Ka, Zumanity, and Love) and one of the "big-top" traveling shows (Varekai), I feel I am a semi-expert on Cirque Du Soleil shows and therefore am entitled to more voting clout.  |-)  As a Cirque Du Soleil show, "Love" has the same major "threads" running through it as all other Cirque Du Soleil shows:  wonderfully imaginative set design and costuming, a couple of comic/clown-ish characters, a couple of weird/eccentric characters, acrobatics, feats of strength and flexibility and balance and bravery, etc.  However, "Love" is much more of a musical and much less of a "circus" show than the other Cirque Du Soleil shows.  The music and the sound is kick-ass:  there are supposedly 3 speakers in *EACH* of the 2000+ seats in the place!!!  The music was re-scored by George Martin and his son, Giles Martin.  We were there for one of the "pre-opening" shows, and at one point, one of the big curtains got stuck in its track in the middle of the stage, and there was much (quiet) frenzy fixing it, but the show went on almost without missing a beat.  If you are a Beatles fan (and who's not?!), you simply *MUST* see "Love".
