      this is by far one of my most favorite restaurants in las vegas.  Ever since discovering this place about 3-4 years ago, i have always been coming back.  this isn't your high end japanese restaurant.   the decor is simple, the prices are very reasonable, the food is extensive and excellent, and the place is great place to be merry.  right when you walk in you are greeted in japanese and when you leave your thanked in japanese.  the workers there all seem to be young students.   there are so many dishes to choose from.  the only thing i can do is tell you about what i always order: 1) menu items:  kushi-katsu - crunchy breaded pork w/lemony teriyaki dip; ika yaki - broiled squid;  ichiza ramen noodles - yummy; seaweed salad; beef tataki - rare beef slice to dip in a ponzu-dailkon radish mixture (sublime); kim chee fried rice; and a sashimi plate w/ tuna, albacore, mackerel, yellow tail, salmon, octopus, and squid. 2) non-menu items (sheets of paper that have daily/common specials are posted over the walls)  monk fish liver, fried smelt (my most favorite b/c the eggs are cooked in the belly), and beef cubes in ponzu sauce.  yeah, there are a lot of dishes that i like, but im so impressed that ichiza's has not disappointed me for the many times i've been there.  They have large group seating areas, which i've enjoyed many times with friends and family eating and drinking up cold sake, sake bombs, and japanese beer.  i really recommend their house cold sake, so much better and smoother than drinking it warm.  i've been there a many nights till closing leaving with my belly full and ridiculously buzzed from all the sake we drank.   i always have to put this on the itinerary of any of my visiting friends and family that come to las vegas.  that's how much i love and trust this place.  anybody who knows me, can back me up for whatever say about this restaurant b/c most likely i've taken them there.... additional note...don't think that this restaurant is one of those upscale dress up places b/c of the amount of stars i gave it.  it gets five stars b/c all around it's hella awesome!!!

      My Vegas go to man brought me here - it's on the top of his list, so he has to always bring us out-of-towners there!   I've been there a couple of times already and can definitely tell you this is one of those joints for only the locals.  No tourists would be venturing out over here.  All that much better!    When looking at the bar and all the special menu items posted on the wall, it can be quite difficult when deciding what to order.  So, when in doubt, let the expert go at it.  I fondly remember the fried smelt (less than $3 for three fish).  These plump babies are loaded up 'cuz their eggs are still sitting inside of them.  And with a little bit of salt and some fresh lemon juice, yum yum!  And who doesn't love ankimo?!  Monkfish liver that melts in your mouth...ahhhh...I love ankimo!  I've tried a bunch of other things there like the red snapper carpaccio with ikura, ramen noodles, the beef tataki w/ lemon juice, fresh oysters on the half shell w/ ponzu sauce (2 for $4.25), seaweed salad, and the beef cubes.  I don't remember anything bad about the place, but just good food with good company.  The first time I went, they had those fancy Japanese toilets with all those buttons to try out.  I attempted to use it but had no luck.  On my last visit, their special toilet was no longer there!  =(  I guess too many people were having way too much fun with it and it went into retirement.    If possible, go with a large group and sit in the back where you have to take your shoes off to swing your feet under the table.  And this way, you can also order a lot more random things and share them with everyone.  It makes it all that much merrier.  Overall, pretty extensive menu...I think I want some of that fried smelt roe just about now!  Bring it!  Updated: 10/10/06 - They also offer a FREE membership card.  You get 5% off whenever you dine there when you bring this card and it eventually adds up to 10-15% off your bill for next time.  I also like getting the Agedashi Tofu soup.  It's light and delicate without being overly infused with the bonito flakes.  Yum yum!  The salmon skin salad was okay.  The dressing overpowers the salmon skin, so you can't taste a whole lot.  I wouldn't bother getting it again.    The deep fried crabs are a plate of baby crabs with an aioli type dipping sauce.  An interesting taste and a nice crunch!   Side note: They give you a wet towelette thing and that will be your napkin for the entire meal.  Don't bother looking around for regular paper napkins here!  Updated: 11/27/06 - I recently tried the okra with natto (less than $3).  First off, the idea of natto grosses me out.  The texture alone is nasty, and the smell...geez, that's a whole other subject.  Since it was my dining partner's first time w/ the stuff, I suggested he give it a go at some a cheap price.  It comes with thin slices of fresh okra, seaweed slivers, and hot mustard on the side.  Overall, I would not recommend it unless you're a fan of this stuff.  I definitely am not one. Blah.    Also, the last two times I went, they were out of the lovely ankimo!  Argh!  Updated: 01/24/07 - I changed my ratings from four stars to five because I find myself craving the fried smelt roe more often than not.  And Ichiza has apparently become my comfort restaurant to turn to when I can't decide where else to go.  I have only been to one other izakaya, and that was Musha in Torrance, CA.  How can this place not be special?  Updated: 06/12/07 - Went back the past weekend after a few month hiatus.  They were out of uni and ankimo!  Argh!  But we had the beef tongue - tasty, and gotta eat it when it's hot; minced spanish mackerel on cucumber - fresh, lots of flavors on your palatte, fried garlic - put salt on it instead of the miso, and oh-so good!, tartar yellowtail - with avocado, crisp things, and salsa - refreshing flavors and light, and honey toast - they need more bread chunks, but yummy!  (They had a few new dishes that were listed in Japanese.  If you ask the waitresses or owner to translate, they'll try their best!  Be daring and give it a go!)  Update! 08/06/07 - Out of ankimo again!  Argh!  But they do have a soft shell crab appetizer that comes with a ponzu dipping sauce and Japanese mayonnaise.  It's a fatty crab with lots of meat!  Yum!  Their red snapper carpaccio is a bit different, it comes with olive oil, tomatoes, and mozzarella!    Update! 10/09/07 - Where the heck is all the ankimo?!  Argh!  Brought some out-of-town guests to Ichiza to experience where the locals eat.  Ate all the standard stuff, of course.  New thing tried here - live scallop.  I warn you now, don't sniff the squiggly things...it may turn you off!  But the scallop slices dipped in ponzu sauce is oh so tasty.  Also shared a ramen bowl.  I'm personally not a big fan of ramen (it's a filler), so I'll pass on it.  Everyone else seemed to swallow it down without any problems! =)  (I added some photos of my eats above!)

      This is about as close to an authentic Japanese izakaya as you'll find anywhere. And I'm talking countrywide.  I've been to several izakaya in Japan over the years and this place just brings me back there immediately.   My japanese buddy in San Francisco is jealous of this place to give you a little perspective on my claim.  The food is incredible and you'll find yourself hard pressed to try everything they have to offer as new items come and go all the time.  I recommend damn near everything on the menu.  If something scares you, ORDER IT, and you'll be pleasently surprised everytime.  If you do try this place, make sure you get a members card, as you will definately be returning.  For every 5$ you spend you get a stamp.  The initial card saves you 5%, fill it up and you save 10%, fill up a second card and you save 15%.  This is permanent by the way, you can use it for every visit.  SO GO THERE ALREADY, and I'll most likely see you there as I am there 4-5 times a week.

      I think these other reviewers have all the bases covered!  I give this place a rare 5 star only because it has no other competition to speak of in Las Vegas, as far as I know.   I have lived in Torrance, Tokyo and now live in West LA (near Sawtelle of course!), so I think I know a thing or two about Izakayas.  This place even has the specials on the wall and runs out of things as the night goes on like a proper Japanese place always does.  I think a lot of people have caught on to this place too, since it was pretty busy.  I think it is a good idea to make reservations.  I had made some, but arrived an hour early.  This place is really tiny, so if you make reservations, be so kind as to show up, because they actually put a sign up and keep standby customers waiting.  I am pretty tired of Hamada, that Japanese place in Bally's near the sportsbook or Sushi King (still sad to see that place go... sad to see the great Stardust shutdown in general) for my Japanese fix.  It is nice to have a pretty good alternative.  Incidentally, I found this place by looking in the phone book.  I just avoided all the Japanese restaurants that had tacky names that a normal Japanese restaurant would never use, such as "Shogun", "Samurai", "Sumo" or similar names.  One last thing, the prices are pretty reasonable as Izakayas go.  I went crazy and ordered a bunch of meat dishes such as gyu-tataki, shiro-maguro-tataki, katsu-o tataki (seeing a theme here?), a few drinks and bunch of other things for three and the bill was still around $100.  I was stuffed to the gills.  And yes, I do have a very hearty appetite.

      Itadakimasu! It's exactly how you feel when you walk into this quaint little place above Tea Planet. Yes....you would never know it was here except for the sounds of fun and mmm mmm smells of Japanese goodness. Ichiza is definitely a jewel  hidden in Vegas. There's nothing more authentic than Ichiza. I just like saying it...Ichiza Ichiza Ichiza. I have taken and introduced people to this place and they have all agreed how fun it is. Not your typical, "yea dude let me get a California Roll" or your run of the mill Chicken Teriyaki. That's not Japanese. We're looking at Mmm mmm broiled squid, and Katsu, real Ramen Noodles - Mmmm tampopo! Kirin Ichiban on draft! I love the Veggie tempura bowls where there's just a nest of veggies over rice with real teriyaki sauce. How can you go wrong? YEA! You won't find your typical teppanyaki chef there making onion volcanos.  Sure there's things here that white people may cringe upon like the gizzard skewers...or even beef tongue....Sweet fried garlic with Natto(a fermented soybean).....The service is a little slow. I figure it's because the place is usually really busy. I like having a place to go to in the middle of the night that can make me feel all warm and fuzzy....and that's not from the Kirin.  If you have enough room. You gotta try the honey toast. It takes some time so order it when you're halfway finished. It's Japanese Toast (like half a loaf of bread) partially hollowed out with butter....honey....and vanilla ice cream. Simple, delicious....and to the point.  I definitely enjoy the Ramen, jalepeno fried rice - yakitori - and the grilled squid...Oooo and grilled makerel, black cod in miso....so much to choose from! This place can fit anyone's budget. The ambiance is traditional japanese, with pictures and specials on the walls, there's a group area that you can sit, but you gotta take your shoes off. The bar is great because you can watch them cook in the kitchen. Overall - a must go place.  If you're a regular here - Get your Ichiza stamp card for a discount.

      I have been using Yelp for restaurant ideas now for several months, but have never been moved to write a review until tonight.  Tonight, there was no way that I would pass up this opportunity to rave about the first true Izakaya tavern that I have found here in Las Vegas.  I have never even heard of Izakaya taverns until a good friend of ours introduced us to Musha in Torrance, CA and it's been a whirlwind love affair since then.  I love the casual, Authentic Japanese atmosphere of these places.  From the entire restaurant staff greeting you with a hearty "Irashaimashite!" as you walk in to the almost-guaranteed "we'll see you next time!"  It's never a goodbye, as they know that you will be back..... oh yes, you WILL be back.   There is just that special feeling that you get when you go to an Izakaya tavern. And it was no different for me this time around.  At first we were leery of this place, seeing as how we have never heard of it until I did a Google search for "Izakaya Vegas".  But the fact that the first hit was a review on Yelp with multiple 5-star recommendations, there was no way I was going to be swayed by my belief that there is no such thing as "Genuine" in Las Vegas.   Am I ever glad that we did.  This place brought back such fond memories of the fun that we had with our friends at Musha.  From the Buta Kakuni to the broiled beef tongue and the Garlic butter clams, this place had everything that I liked Including more reasonable pricing!  Dishes ranged from $1.75 for assorted single skewered meats (Beef tongue, chicken wings, chicken balls) to around $8.95+  for the sashimi plates, with most items ranging in the $4-$5 range. For our first visit, we tried out the: -Shisyamo Age - which are crisp deep fried smelt(3 pieces) stuffed with roe - Boneless and absolutely delicious with either the provided salt or some asked-for ponzu.  -Beef Tataki - Tender seared beef slices dipped in Ponzu  -Yamakake - Tuna sashimi with Yam Potato and some slimy stuff that I just could not identify (I liked it, but people who judge food by texture may be turned off by it. - Not for everybody)  -Vegetable Croquettes - Mashed potatoes, veggies, wrapped in panko and fried until the outside is crisp and crunchy while the inside if hot and well.... mashed potatoe'y?  kind of like a breaded and deep fried Sheperd's Pie, I suppose.  - Broiled Black Cod - The Hands-Down star of tonight's dinner.  Yummy buttery black cod with a sweet tangy marinade and the skin broiled to a crisp ... absolutely delightful.  - Kushi-Tan - Broiled beef tongue on a skewer - The staple of every Izakaya tavern I've ever been to.  A Squeeze of lemon and you're good to go.  - Kaku-ni - Pork Belly, simmered for hours in mirin, shoyu, sugar etc. until it's chopstick-tender and practically melts in your mouth.  Can sometimes be really fatty because of the cut of the meat, but lucikly ours was fairly lean, maybe we got lucky, or maybe they select leaner cuts?  Guess I'll have to order it again next time to find out!  a small bowl of rice is a must.  - And the clencher - Bacon wrapped Mochi on a stick. Broiled to a crisp, yet chewy .... and bacon'y .....  and mochi'y ... it's freaking mocchi and bacon, how else would you describe it? ... you need to try this for yourself if you're adventurous enough, or just hate your heart.  Ichiza is definitely an instant favorite and a must-visit for all of my out-of-town buds.

      Good service and great food. We drank and ate a TON of food and our bill was $60. Things we ate that we would order again.  The Ramen with the pork kakuni Monk fish pate with cucumbers and seaweed. Beef Tataki KIMCHI &amp; PORK STIR FRY WAS THE BOMB! The charashi roll-- I freakin loved the shiso in this roll!!  -------------------------------------------------- Since I wrote this review, I've been back 3 more times and I have down graded my 5 star review to a 4 star because of the service. This place is still da bomb but the service here is spotty. Drink your beer and order two more because they ain't comin' back to check. You want more sake? Good luck. Come here with patience and a flask.

      Awesome!  I ate here on Sunday 3/25/07...   Jimmy's Tip:  Don't come here for sushi...  I was on my wife's Blackberry searching for SUSHI in the remaining 3 hours i had before my 8PM flight back to SFO.  I didn't want to eat on the strip and I didn't want to eat at a restaurant I've tried before.  Doing a search for "sushi" in Las Vegas on yelp! brought up Ichiza in the top 10 listings.  The 13 reviews all with 5 STAR ratings set very high expectations.  So I recommended it to my cousins and wife that we try this place out.  I'm so glad we did because the food was excellent, the service was fast and friendly, and the prices reasonable!!!   Our party of 4 adults and 1 two-year old tried a lot for $85.     I had and enjoyed the:  Beef Curry ~$6.00  Okra Tempura - $4.50 Aspara-Bacon - ~$4.00 (?) Green Tea Ice Cream Sapporo Large   I would absolutely return!!!  It's worth the trip!  more laters...

      Tasty Japanese tapas, reasonably priced, local lore.   Definitely not a tourist trap, and definitely beat all the touristy food locations on the Strip.   There was a host of things to try including menu items written on the walls.  Somethings are a little on what some might consider the bit experimental side:  bits of this animal and that animal, e.g. beef tongue.  Still i had a great experience.  One thing they should do is take all the items on the wall, and incorporate those into the menu cause there were far too many and some were out of range to see.  My favorites were the bbq squid, the hamachi nachos, and the tofu salad (the exact dish name I can't remember).  We ordered pretty much everything we wanted to eat and then some including sake and the final price per person was only $33 each.  I think this place beats a lot of the places on the Strip hands down.  Taxi drives don't know about this place so be prepared to provide directions and an address when you go.  It was about a $10 cab ride from the Strip.  Service was definitely friendly and attentive.

      Super tasty, great variety, and the service is wonderful.  The waitresses were very nice, answered our questions, and didn't avoid our table when it was clear that we ordered in rounds (4 rounds of orders in total).  We tried things we normally don't get, like beef tongue.  Didn't try the sushi.  The ambiance was nice and a bit trendy without being intimidating.  Our meal for three came out to about $50 for about eight plates and one glass of house sake.  Oh, late night people note: They're open until 3 am (except on Sunday when they close at 2:30).  We'll be coming here for late night refuels next time we're in town.  I only wish they made copies of the "wall specials" so you can examine them at your table instead of standing behind someone to read the signs.

      I picked this place based solely on Yelp reviews, as we were looking to feed a large party.  We wanted excellent food but given the size of our party and the length of our stay - we wanted to keep the cost economical on at least one evening.  Ichiza was perfect.  I think I'd have to go back 40 times to even believe I tried everything.  Everything that we ordered was great food, fresh and tasty.... and unusual, too.  Starting with the beef tongue skewers, which I deliberately called beef skewers to my friends, were very good and most ate theirs even after they knew what it was, though some of them chickened out, as expected.  Uni-topped ricecakes wrapped in seaweed, tofu salad, bbq squid, hamachi dishes galore, and other terrific things.  Our server made a few recommendations too, as there was simply no way for us to pick, given the huge variety of items up on the wall and on our menus.  Our party of 14 did have to sit a bit parted, in two tables next to one another, in an area to the side where you take your shoes off  to sit down.  It was intimate enough, but would have been nicer if it was one large table, but it IS a small restaurant, so.... My table, which consisted of 6 people, had a separate bill.  We ordered a LOT of food, and we were stuffed to the gills by the time we left.  We also ordered at least 5 or 6 bottles of unfiltered sake.... which my friends pounded like it Gatorade.  All in all - between the six of us, with all that food and alcohol, it merely came to $33 per person.  Economical, indeed.  Ichiza, while located far from the strip on the second floor of a "Chinatown" strip mall - - is definitely worth a visit on your trip to Vegas.  Excellent food, friendly and casual atmosphere, and good service.  It's guaranteed to be a good evening.  FYI:  Do NOT use the website to make reservations.  Being the worrywart that I can be, I called a few days after having made web reservations to confirm my party's reservation was indeed existent.  Good thing I did, too, because they had no record of it.  I am not sure what happened, but I then proceeded to freak out and ask if we can still come in on Friday and they said that was perfectly fine.  So if you are going here with a large party and plan to make reservations - -  pick up the phone and call.  Do NOT use their website....

      ichiza = sake bombs + yakitori! (:  it reminds me of the yakitori place at st.marks place (near nyu) but the downfall of this lovely little hole is that word spreads...which means more traffic, more people (good for ichiza's owners)...but that also means, wait lines, no seats, and cranky, hungry elizabeth o. smoking an entire pack out on the balcony...  i liked ichiza over the summer when all the international unlv students went back home, and i didn't have to wait! so i hardly go there anymore on the weekends because it's so crazy hectic in there these days. if it's slowing down, please tell me otherwise; it's been a while...  i miss those summer daze.

      This place is alright.  There's a lot of stuff to order which isn't even listed on the menu that's given to you.  You just kind of have to look around at the food that's written on the pieces of paper all around the place.  It can get a bit crowded, and it's hard to sit if you have a lot of people in your group.    The food is pretty small portion wise thought it's not bad.  I actually thought the baby soft shell crab was interesting.  I have no idea what the names of the foods were since I arrived a bit late so sorry about that, but nothing was that bad or great even.  It was good though.    The sake and beer prices aren't too bad either since that's what I like doing... drinking!  It's an okay place to chill, but a bit small for my taste.

      This is one of the best Japanese spots I have ever been to.  The place is simple but the menu is nothing close to simple.  Ichiza has a plethoraor interesting plates and tapas of Japanese creations.  The fish is fresh but come here for more than sushi/sashimi.  You will find plates that you have never seen here and will want it to be your last dish.

      OK guys! This is a solid Yelp-recommended kappo place. I really loved the overall experience, up until the very end, when suddenly I got one unexpected &amp; unfortunate issue with it. When we finished dinner (we had ordered a huge load of food and paid about $57 per person, for 2 people, incl. a good 18% tip) we exited the restaurant and the predominantly Japanese staff didn't say a simple thank you. The Japanese host (manager?) saw us leaving, turned a blind eye and continued chatting with the waitress as if we didn't exist.  I regret giving you a lower rating (I initially intended a 5) but I am an emotional and spoiled client- I got upset... I'm half Japanese... I know it is not written on my (Caucasian) face, but I am. My appearance is not an excuse for anyone to forget to say a simple "thank you" especially when it's part of the Japanese cultural code. As we all know. Even a Korean-owned Japanese restaurant in LA area is trying to always say "Arigato Gozaimasu" (with a heavy accent, but still, polite and respectful). I never had an experience where Japanese nationals operating a restaurant- in the US or in Japan- disregarded this centuries-old cultural rule.  OK... the tantrum is over now, guys- sorry. Yelp is all about being subjective and emotional about our experiences- and it is exactly what I am doing. I wish that I had the desire to write more about the food rather than freaking out regarding a cultural issue...  In spite of the "shitsurei"- hopefully an isolated incident without any mean attitude or intentions behind it- I DO RECOMMEND this restaurant as one of the good Nihon-ryori restaurants in Las Vegas. Also, conveniently, it is open quite late. Maybe other Yelpers who are less spoiled or less familiar with Japanese customs (not expecting as much from their experience) will really have a blast.

      Thank goodness for YELP. I wouldn't have discovered this restaurant without all the good reviews about it.   I love tastings of different  dishes when I dine out. Ichiza has quality tapas size dishes at very reasonable prices. For those reasons, this is now my favorite Japanese restaurant.   The BF and I shared:  uni w/ponzu grilled squid  yellowtail, salmon, mackerel, tuna, albacore sashimi combo grilled smelt roe - fellow yelpers influence :)  fried oyster - I was craving the fresh oysters, but they were out :( shrimp fried rice  beef tataki beer   calpico shu ========= $70  The sashimi and uni were very fresh. After reading some of the reviews, I had to try the smelt roe.  I didn't know how to eat the smelt roe, but shared the dish with another patron at the bar and watched him eat it first. It was tasty. All the dishes we ordered were yummy! I will definitely come back here on each Vegas trip.

      I like this place alot, its within walking distance from my house, loud and informal, authentic, and a blast.  Anywhere you sit you are bombarded by noise, smells, glossy pictures of the food, and occassionally someone's sloppy elbow.  in a town of over inflated celebrity chef pet restaurants, a place like this fills the niche.    the food is solid japanese counter fare, fresh seafood, great rolls, it comes out whenever.  the service is usually pretty quick and they love giving out fresh beers.  plus they serve pork belly which is a huge plus in my book.  definately hit the spider roll, the yellowfin tartare, the pork belly and napa stir fry, and the HONEY TOAST!!..  where else can you get half a loaf of bread filled with icecream?

      This place was introduced to me by my dear friends from work.  The only thing I've had is the beef bowl, but it is delish! Beef with noodles and onions over rice.    Parking is always crowded and cash only for smaller purchases.

      **200th review**  Who knew in the middle of the desert you would actually find an authentic Japanese Sake House??? Hidden in a random strip mall, Ichiza serves up some tons of Japanese style tapas for everyone to enjoy.  Came here for dinner with some friends... because we didn't want the typical buffet dinner or the calories that is often associated with Vegas.  Decor was charming. It had 2 sections of large tables with the tatami style seating.  It was pretty quaint.  The lamps were really dope. They were homemade and it looked like philo dough bound with a fish grill on it. It was pretty impressive. They also had the typical hand made signs of the specials plastered all over the bar.  The service was spotty unfortunately however our waitress was really cute with a cute Japanese accent.  When asked about recommendations, there were none.... she replied that everything was good.  Don't come here being extremely hungry... the portions are smaller than the typical sake houses in LA, but hey, its supposed to be appetizers, right?  The karrage Chicken was really good- tender and not too much batter... the pork and kimchi was delicious... the chicken wings and yakatori were not very good. Perhaps adding some fresh wasabi and lemon juice would have kicked it up a notch??? Agadashi Tofu was weak in flavor.. have had better in LA.  Best dish of the night?  The sea bass which was delicious and excellent. Highly recommended. Very moist and perfectly cooked in a sweet soy sauce. I could have devoured that entire dish myself!  Order a pitcher of Kirin, some Calpis Sochu, and some sake and you got yourself a rockin Japanese style party! Recommended and will tell my friends about this place for sure in the future!

      If you want dinner at 1:30 in the am, Ichiza is the place to go.  Our server was awesome, friendly, and recommended some great dishes!  Don't be fooled by the menu they hand you - the real menu, with the yummiest dishes, are on the wall!  We ordered mini deep fried soft shell crabs, bacon wrapped sticky rice (holy ichiza!), mussles, clams, etc. All waaaaay under budget and waaaaayyy fantastical.  Oh and if you're a big drinker, order one of their shoju drinks  - I had a grapefruit cocktail and they served the glass almost full to the brim with half a fresh grapefruit that I got to squeeze all by myself. Refreshing and scarily good - I mean as in I'll order two drinks 'cuz it tastes like juice good.   Will definitely make it a point to come here every time I'm in Vegas even though it's off the strip!

      Went and ate at Ichiza last night based off of all the reviews I have read on Yelp. And I have to say that I loved it. Had a short wait when we arrived, but I think you get that at all good places, and we were seated in less then 10 minutes. The menu items written all over the walls were fun to read and interpret, but I wonder if I missed out on anything good because I didnt see it written somewhere. :) And some of them were written only in Japanese, so I wondered what they were. Next time I am going to order all the items I cant read, and just be surprised when thing show up.  "I'll take that, and that, and that..."  We ordered the deep fried baby soft shell crabs, marinated minced spanish mackerel, Kimchi fried rice, tartar yellowtail, wasabi green bean tempura, and the Mapo-tofu (all for only $44, including 2 large Sapporos).  Everthing was great. The yellowtail was recommended by several people on Yelp, and I agree with them. It was great. A little messy, but I didnt mind that. The baby soft shell crabs kind of caught me by surprise, because they werent kidding about "baby" These little things looked like they had just been born, and hadnt had time to grow a shell yet...But they were very tasty. I liked the Marinated Spanish mackerel, served on top of a cucumber wedge, and the Kimchi fried rice was very good too. The beer prices were great too. $5.50 for a large Sapporo, I have paid alot more than that at other places.  The staff was all very friendly, and helpful, and I think everyone who worked there said good bye, and see you next time, as we were leaving. I will diffinately be going back. In fact, I cant wait too.  UPDATE: went here again Saturday evening and it was even better the second time. I'm upgrading Ichiza to 5 stars.

      I have been to Ichiza twice and I have had great experiences both times. Both times I have been there, there was a short wait.  I have been seated at both a table and at the bar.  Service was good, and everyone was friendly. The first time I went I was with an Ichiza veteran who knew exactly what to order, so I had a whole mess of stuff, and can't really remember what any of it was, could have been the fact her expertise included mass quantities of sake. I remembered the kimchi fried rice and mapo-tofu and ordered those again on my second visit.  The next time I went we were a little more daring and did most of our ordering off the walls. Once again everything was yummy.  I was not a huge fan of the minced Spanish mackerel, but it was okay.  The tartar yellowtail was delicious, but a bit of a challenge to eat. When I lost about half of it down my shirt, it was good for a laugh. :) The prices are very reasonable, and I left full and happy.  Since my first review, I have been back many times, and I have always had a great experience.  Tonight the folks at Ichiza went above and beyond!!  There was a bit of a wait, so we went downstairs to Tea Planet, and we didn't have enough time to finish our drinks.  We went in Ichiza half expecting them to tell us no outside drinks, which they did...HOWEVER, they offered to put our drinks in the refrigerator for us so they wouldn't go to waste! Just another reason to love Ichiza, and in case you need another...two words...honey toast. YUM!

      UPDATED 12-27-07: Came here again and this time it wasn't as good as before. I don't know what it is. This time, even though it was good, it just didn't blow me away like last time. So one star off. ---------------------------------  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU to all the yelpers who rated this place highly. That was the main reason why we bookmarked it and decided to check it out. I wasn't sure how late they were open but we arrived pretty late, around 10pm and crossed our fingers as we entered. Man, it was bustling! Turns out they were open until 3am Mon-Sat, until 2.30am on Sundays. However, last call is 45 mins before closing so make sure you arrive on time.  So there were 2 guys waiting for a table and the hostess asked if we wanted to sit at the counter. Lil guy was all for it. So, counter it was. I was just fascinated by the atmosphere in here. There were 2 tatami tables with very drunk people singing and carrying on. They were obviously having a good time.  We were given menus but it was the posted items above our heads which interested me. Hubby left the ordering to me. I ordered an udon ($6.35) for little guy with his usual edamame ($3) and agedashi tofu ($4.35). Then, I proceeded to order a bunch of items for us adults.  Uni pon ($5.50) arrived first. It was 4 plump pieces of uni sitting on thinly sliced cucumbers nestled on daikon spaghetti wading in a pool of ponzu sauce. OMG it was fantastic. The uni was soooooo fresh and flavorful. I could've eaten 3 of these.  Then came the salmon skin salad ($5). This was no ordinary salmon skin salad. This was the emperor of all salmon skin salads I've ever had. Crunchy slivers of carrot, shreds of lettuce, grape tomatoes, daikon sprouts, perfectly cooked salmon skin, grated daikon, topped with a dollop of roe. Hubby and I shared this but were fighting over who got the last morsel.   Taramiso, otherwise known as miso butterfish ($5.50) is something I've been craving since leaving Hawaii. I used to eat it at least once a week. After a year of missing it and seeing it on the menu here was enough for me to kiss the ground of this izakaya. The taramiso did not disappoint. In fact, it was so perfect hubby and I again commented on how much we've missed this dish.  All the while, lil guy was enjoying his udon, edamame and agedashi tofu while watching his portable DVD player oblivious of all the ongoings around him.   Tofu salad with tuna sashimi ($7.50) was interesting yet refreshingly delicious. Romaine lettuce, followed by mashed tofu, topped with diced avocado and cubed tuna sashimi, toss in a few daikon sprouts and a pinch of bonito flakes and voila, a masterpiece. The grape tomatoes complete this both in color and texture.  Of course an izakaya meal isn't complete without some sort of alcohol. We had 2 large bottles of Asahi draft ($5.50/bottle) and then we finished by sharing a bowl of miso chasu ramen with extra chasu ($10). I'm sorry, but Santouka Ramen does not measure up to the ramen here and it was the last item we ate. The broth was perfect, not too salty and not under flavored. The chasu had just the right amount of fat interspersed with the lean bits. It looked like pancetta. Hubby was a bit skeptical but I assured him he would like it, and guess what? He did.  This is definitely bookmarked for our next visit to Vegas, and let me tell you this, I'm reliving my meal right now just by writing this review and the bad part is, I'm not eating the food as I'm writing this. BUMMER!

      Hell yes.   This is modern Japanese comfort food in a setting truer to the motherland. If you have the chance, go with someone that knows a little about Japanese food and you have a little bit of an upper hand over the average gaijin.   My faves are the ika-yaki, baby octopus, udama-age (fried quail eggs), salmon sashimi, oyako donburi, stewed spinach, um ... everything is good.   If you're feeling adventurous, try the natto or okra. But be warned, you have to be in a really adventurous mood.   The only peril about this place is the munchie-factor. I took two friends here after they both smoked greens and between the three of us, we racked up like, a $150 bill or something. Everything is just too good.   The fobbie waitresss are super cute.   And for some reason the sake always tastes supreme there.   * off the strip, non-casino

      oh schnaP! I came out of this restaurant beating on my bf and asking him why restaurants like this don't exist in SF.  With the number of Japanese Americans in the bay area, WHY CANT THERE BE A DECENT IZAKAYA?!?  WHY!  Ichiza, please come to the bay.  I'll come every weekend I promise.  Anyway.  With the help of you yelpers, I made up my mind to come to Ichiza the day we arrived in Vegas because  knew this place was open til 3.  We lugged our luggage in like true tourists and just started ordering off the wall and getting a bottle of Sapporo.  We had all sorts of things that night but the uni in ponzu sauce was TO DIE for.  It was the best thing ever i wanted to order like 10 of them.  Each little dish is meant for you to drink some beer with and savor and sample.  I'd love to come with a BUNCH of people and just order all types of food.  We also tried their spicy kara-age (good), miso cod (good), fried oysters (really good) and I wanted to try a lot of other stuff too but we were full. The noodle dishes here looked amazing and their little donburis looked good too.  It's comfort food and places like this that make me miss my mom's cooking and Tokyo. DAMMIT.  Prices were reasonable, service was good, atmosphere ROCKED.  It's a lil out there if youre staying near the strip.  Best meal I've had in a while.

      If you were wondering where Vegas isn't over the top, it's on the second floor of a strip mall.  Repeated and gushy kudos to yelpers for making this place known, and as we stopped in yesterday, we were treated to a cornucopia of delicious and authentic Japanese cuisine;  a little sushi, a little asparagus wrapped in bacon (!), a tactile bowl of rice, chicken and egg and we left not only happy, but nearly deliriously so.  You sometimes feel like you're cheating the house when you hit up a genuinely and ethnically spot-on stop like Ichiza, but thanks to you guys who found this place first, it was totally worth the cab fare there and back.  If we had more time here we'd go back, and the next time we're in town, we are going back, definitely.  What a treat.

      This place was what started my ramen craze!  Their udon dish and fried rice was so delicous, actually everything is!  Not only that, this is the only sushi spot that I know of... opening until 2a.m. and the food is authentic japanese cuisine, since the staff is literally only japanese.  The tables maybe small and everything, and the size of the restaurant isn't all that big... but the service is great.     If we had a restuarant that was similar to this place in the area, I think it would be banking in hella money and on top of that, its not very often that you go to a restuarant and order ramen noodle.  *Still thinking about*..... gawd..... I'm hungry for ramen.

      Good call on this place fellow yelpers.  Vegas is a fun place to visit, but things can get really old really fast out there.  This is when I turn to yelp for something new and good.  And Ichiza is both.  The food was good.  I can't say we tried everything on the menu, but we sure did try.  The sushi was nice and fresh.  The yakatori was good.  Even the gizzards (which I'm not a big fan of) were delicious.  Haven't tried the desserts but looking forward to it next time.  The best part was considering how much beer and sake we drank, the bill was still a bargain.  This will be a staple ever time I go back.  Venture away from the Strip and discover the other places you can eat and play in Vegas.  Lastly, I know this is the land of buffets, but sometimes it's just not worth it.  Why stuff yourself with bad food when you can eat quality dishes at a sit down?  viva la yelp
