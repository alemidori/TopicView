      If you've been to Sushi-mon on Maryland Pwky (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-mon-las-vegas) then you'll most likely enjoy Goyemon since its owned the same management as well as Monta.   The restaurant is in a plaza with plenty of parking (spaces are arrange awkwardly though). They're opened 5PM to 3AM, great for the early dinner people and the late night munchies crowd. The restaurant is not huge, but I would say big enough for at least 50 patrons. All you can eat (AYCE) is $27.    The menu seems to be the same as Sushi Mon, all except the extra items that were added to the blackboard and featured on the place mat. Some of the items were:  Grilled Tofu Salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=uTwz4uGpvFM6H8EttW-MVg). I've never had grilled tofu before, but it was interestingly good. The taste of the grilled tofu with a garlic sesame sauce was a good way to start the night.   Grilled Pork Belly (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=1pQReeZwUFgCpzY7qJ5rfA). Was similar to Monta's pork, but in a thick slice form.  Speaking of Monta, for whatever reason the Shoyu ramen is offered after 11pm. Not sure if the tonkutsu or miso are offered as well.  Extra desserts not on the regular menu were tofu cheesecake, green tea creme brulee, and a green tea mousse cake, all were presented nicely and a nice touch for a AYCE sushi place.   What I really enjoyed was the quality of the fish for a AYCE place. It was like they were not affected by the economy and continue to serve fish that wasn't chewy or smelled. Yay, but too bad they still use krab.   The service was excellent was well, the server checked up on my party quite often and we did not have to wait long receive our orders. One of my friend's ordered a shrimp nigiri and a few moments later the server came back asking if he wanted to try deep fried shrimp heads as well, with no cost of course since its AYCE. They actually want you to enjoy your meal haha.  Another plus is that I don't have to drive all the way to Maryland Pwky to get some quality AYCE anymore. If you feel the same way then.. *high five*.

      My love for sushi brought me to this place due to my friend's recommendation and let's just say that it was definitely not a disappointment. We arrived around 7pm on a Saturday night and there was an empty bar (totally meant to be for us). Shortly after (like 15 minutes later) the restaurant was full and there was a wait...luckily we got there at just the right time. This might be the new "it" place for sushi.  The sushi chef asked if we have been here before and we said no. He asked if we have been to the Sushi Mon on (Silverado and Maryland Pkwy), we said yes. He said the menu was the same except for the specials. There was a special menu that listed all the specials.   We started off with the specials.....toro (yes, fatty tuna) was on the specials menu!!!! This is totally not an all you can eat item! Some other items like the cajun salmon, big eye tuna, etc were also on there. We got our sushi pretty quickly and let's just say the quality was superb. One thing that I noticed quickly was that the nigri was not over stuffed with rice. It was a lil bit of rice with a lot of fish...definitely NOT your typical AYCE. We were able to try the grilled pork belly, a bunch of other nigiri and a few rolls. I don't think I had anything that I didn't like.   Dessert was good. They had this lychee sherbert that had chunks of lychee in it. I also tried the green tea creme brulee as well as the green tea cake. I think the lychee sherbert stole my heart though and that alone will make me come back.  Service was attentive for how busy they were, fish was fresh and everything was delicious. I will be back! OHHHH and there's a frequent stamp card too...totally worth it.

      Wow wow wow definitely the best all you can eat Japanese place in Las Vegas.  I don't think it's even close.  According to our very nice and helpful sushi chef, this is owned by the same folks who own Monta Ramen.  And Monta Ramen is delicious.  In fact, you can order the same ramen after 11 pm.  Either a la carte or as part of the all you can eat deal.  Not sure I'd fill up on Ramen when getting AYCE but it's nice to have options.    Pork belly - Wow.  Just absolutely deliciously fatty, crispy, and delicious.  The edges just have that beautiful crispiness you get from cooking it just right.  The rest just melts in your mouth. Spicy tuna on a "cracker" - pretty awesome.  It was like toasted rice topped with spicy tuna and their sauce.  Delicious. Grilled veggies - 2 small tomatoes slightly charred and perfectly tangy and delicious.  Nice mushroom, asparagus, and sweet potato slices.  I'm on a low carb thing now and, had I not broken my diet by eating some sushi rolls, I probably would have eaten 4 of the veggie plates and 4 of the pork belly plates. Sushi rolls - don't remember all I had.  Spicy tuna was good.  California was just ok but better than you'll get at other AYCE places.  Yellowtail was good. Green Tea creme brulee - not too sweet and delicious.  Custard was nice and soft.  Sugar on top crispy and caramelized beautifully.  All in all - with the environment, great staff, and most importantly great food you will not regret coming here.  Just high quality for an AYCE place.  Get the pork belly!

      EDIT - this place has been really inconsistent - --------------------  Didn't think I'd ever give an AYCE Sushi place 5 stars till now.   The sushi here was really fresh.  I was really pleased with the salmon belly, yellowtail, big eye tuna, super white tuna, mackeral,sweet shrimp, and much more.  The fish to rice ratio was spot on and it just tasted of a better grade compared to all the other AYCE's.  In addition to the nigiri, we got the grilled pork belly (think we got 6-7 orders total between 3 of us), grilled vegetables, spicy tuna on crips rice, and much more.  Definitely order the specials off the chalk board - some of them have limits of 1 per person.  No toro the day we went.  Also, go after 11pm to get Shoyu Ramen.  It is the same as Monta.    The atmosphere is probably the nicest of any AYCE.  As stated, they are in the Monta Ramen family, so I am hopeful the sushi quality and consistency will remain.    I've tried over a dozen AYCE sushi places in Vegas.  Please - if you know of any better, message me.  Unitl, then I will be coming back here with my stamp card.  9 more till the freebie!

      What can I say, Goyemon tops my favorite Sushi Mon on S. Maryland Pkwy.  This place has the same menu, plus extra daily specials that are part of the AYCE.  They also accept the SushiMon frequent diner card.    Highlights were the specials such as the Kobe beef (cooked medium rare/rare) which melted in your mouth and other specialty green tea desserts.  There is still ayce on the mochi ice cream (unlike other stingy ayce places around town that only limit you to ONE mochi ice cream).  Try the grilled pork belly. It's a little on the salty side, but remember to eat it with the pineapple salsa.  Uni/sea urchin was super fresh, so was the sweet shrimp, and other cuts of fish that came out.  The shrimp tempura and fried shrimp heads were delicious, and the ahi poke was perfectly seasoned.    This place is pretty dang good.

      I'm seriously considering going back to all my AYCE sushi reviews and moving them down a star. THAT's how good it was.   I can't believe this is the 3rd Japanese restaurant in this location in 5 years. To go from Sushi Hana to Shin to this. Goyemon has by far the best decor of the three. Sushi Hana just had these gross green painted walls and an old ass TV showing ESPN for chrissakes!   Along with your usual suspects for nigiri and rolls...they have a ton more including daily specials. Highlights included their inhouse smoked salmon (smokiest salmon ever!), big eye tuna nigiri and "kobe" beef nigiri although the beef being kobe was highly suspect. No big deal. Pork belly was like the best piece of bacon ever.   I also like how yellowtail collar (1 order per person) is on the menu. So good! Its like a super meaty fish chicken wing kinda sorta. A must.   We were pretty lucky to be seated around 6pm since there was a bit of a wait for tables about 10 min later. Not that many seats so definitely be prepared to stand around for a while.   I love how this is so close to my place. No more drives to Sushi Mon on Sahara for me. I'm actually ready to go back here...like...now.

      Although Sushi House Goyemon serves up a favorable price for their AYCE, we decided to take on the a la carte menu.  Either way I think our taste buds and appetites would have been satisfied.  Next time though I'm going after that AYCE!  We were ignorant in not reading the menu thoroughly.  A handful of the items we ordered were included in the AYCE menu.  You get 60 minutes to eat your share of sushi.  Oh yeah!  It's possible and then some.  It's a pity we weren't hungry last night but it gives me something to look forward to when I go to Las Vegas again.  As far as our food, we ordered the following:  Grilled Pork Belly - 2 orders Amaebi Uni Sushi Sushi &amp; Sashimi for 2 Moon Roll Screaming Orgasm Yellowtail Collar Green Tea Creme Brûlée Tempura Ice Cream  Everything was good with maybe the exception of the tuna from the Sushi &amp; Sashimi for 2.  Otherwise, everything was excellent!  I highly recommend the Screaming Orgasm, Pork Belly, and Amaebi, all of which are included in the AYCE.  Truly a great sushi find in Las Vegas, and one that's open late till 3am.

      It's 'bout time for me to review this place since I've already gotten 9 stamps on my Goyemon buy 10 get 11th free card!  I've been to this place 3 times in the past month with different friends each time.  Everyone liked it.  I personally have had better sushi but for all you can eat this is as good as it gets in Vegas.   I love their menu.  You don't usually find sashimi salad, tuna rice cracker, orgasm salad, grilled pork belly, cold tofu, green tea creme bulee, tofu cheese cake, kobe beef (special) in the other all you can eat places.  I've also heard good things about the pork nuggets dish and the teriyaki dishes.  Thumbs up for the decent size cut and small rice portion.   I prefer Nigiri to sushi.  My favorites are salmon roe, white tuna, salmon, yellow tale, red snapper.  I'm not a uni person but my friends who eat uni said it was good.    Good service.  I didn't like the service at all on my first visit but on the last two visits we had great service.  It's not a big place so sometimes there's a wait and I'm not sure if they take reservation.  This is definitely our new favorite all you can eat place.  I hope Goyemon keeps it up!

      Finally went here after reading reviews and a friend telling us about it. I am sad to hear the two Sushimon's are not related ( only because of my stamp card at Sushimon on Sahara and I wish I could use it at here or Sushimon Maryland). Sahara Sushimon has really gone downhill so we tried Goyemon. We sat at the sushi bar. The sushi chef was very friendly and attentive. I noticed when sitting at the bar at any other AYCE sushi (specifically Hikari- you need to scream your order and get his attention). Here-he asked us what we wanted very often and I did not even have to try to get his attention. It was really amazing service. The green tea creme brulee stands out to me and the spicy tuna on crispy rice. I love how you get a small amount of rice with nigiri. Everything tasted fresh and came out very fast.   My biggest disappointments: sashimi salad-I am a big sashimi salad fan and their sashimi is truly disgusting. I think it has ponzu on it (gag). I could barely eat it. That being said the best sashimi salad I have ever had in Vegas is at I Love Sushi. Now that has homemade dressing on top.   Cold grilled tofu salad-that dressing is gross. I could not finish the salad.   It's sad because I love tofu and sashimi and it sucks the dressing on both ruined the salad.   Otherwise, loved it and will probably be back for the other items!

      WOW.  This place really makes AYCE sushi unique.  Not only are there the usual crazy rolls deep fried/sauce to the extreme/yadda yadda, BUT   There is...... PORK BELLY!!  All you can eat PORK BELLY!!!!  This pork belly was grilled with a sweet teriyaki like glaze and a side of mango salsa.  Perfection.  Fatty smokey perfection.  Other notable unique items: 1.  Spicy tuna on crispy sushi rice - Chewy, slightly spicy and slightly sweet.  I liked it more for the fun chewy texture but the man did not fancy it as much.  Strange, he's usually a fan of anything tuna.   2.  Tofu cheesecake - fluffier and not as heavy as its American counterpart, but when it comes to an amazing asian style cheesecake, Raku still wins hands down for their fluffy cheesecake.  We did not try any of the specialty rolls at all, but everyone around us seemed to be enjoying them.  We tried pretty much all the nigiri menu items (tuna, albacore, seared albacore, cajun albacore, white albacore, super white tuna, red snapper, mackeral, sweet shrimp, uni, salmon, ....). Most everything seemed pretty good, but there were some that were definitely more fresh than others and some we could have skipped (shrimp).  That didn't stop the two of us from gorging ourselves with enough fish to feed a small family.  Conclusion:  The owners of Sushimon should be proud of their new shining star of AYCE.

      This place is Sushimon (Maryland and Silverado Ranch) on steroids.  Same great quality as Sushi mon but with new added specials and homemde desserts.  The green tea cake is very tasty.    The ambience is more elegant an deep rich dark colors that are very modern an inviting.  Their Sushi bar is smaller but they have a grill/range in view of the dinning room.  I am always a fan of open kitchens, that way I know if my food was handled properly (which it always is).    The sushi is so far superior in quality to most other AYCE locations I have tried.  If you can say it, sit at the bar and order OMAKASE.  The Sushi chefs are really inventive and have ingredients that are not listed on the menu which they prepare for fun.  It is a top notch dining experience.   GO, EAT, BE HAPPY!

      Having being loyal to another establishment for the last few years I ventured out to try a new place that would satisfy my appetite and palette.  I was guided here by the folks from Monta noodle House.   First and foremost let me just say this place will now be one of my favorite spots for sushi,  I can say that each piece was pure balance of flavor &amp; taste. All of their varied great dishes and add-ons were prepared with good flavor, even their personal sashimi salad was well made and was a great opening dish.   The extra white tuna was phenomenal, and it melted in my mouth all the rolls we had were well balanced and made with the greatest attention, I complimented all of the dishes with a small tasting of 3 of their best sakes which helped all the flavors unfold in my palette. I recommend eating at the sushi-bar since you get a chance to interact with the sushi chefs and get everything at your will.  Enjoy

      I absolutely love all you can eat sushi so when I heard about this place opening up from an ad posted inside of Monta Noodle House, I was like "I'm so there!" Not to mention the fact that it's a sister restaurant to one of my personal favorites, Sushi-Mon.  This place should actually be five stars considering everything that they have to offer and the fact that every single bit of it is absolutely delicious but I gave it four mainly due to the fact that I thought it was going to be a new sushi experience when it actually wasn't. They pretty much have exactly the same menu from Sushi-Mon plus a bit more so I was kind of disappointed that it was just Sushi-Mon 2.0  That little fact shouldn't discourage you from going to eat here though. As I previously stated, the food is fantastic. From the nigiri to the specialty rolls, all the way down to the sides and dessert, this place knows how to bring their A game.  If you're looking for a good sushi experience, Goyemon is an excellent place to start.  It's like 10 minutes off the strip so if you're an out of towner, this place isn't too much of a hassle to get to, although when I went there was a wait time so I would suggest calling ahead. Not sure if they do reservations but it wouldn't hurt to ask right?

      Great new AYCE sushi restaurant with some nice additions you don't get in the other AYCE places.   Small restaurant but did not feel rushed by the servers.  Service was great.  Uni and sweet shrimp was really fresh.  Too bad only one order per customer, but lucky for me my dinner companion is allergic.  Will definitely be back.    Too bad they don't have the plum ice cream served at Sushi Mon on Sahara!  Looked everywhere for that plum ice cream and cannot buy it anywhere!!!

      After reading many reviews on Yelp and my like of Sushimon we decided to try this sushi place a few days ago.  I enjoyed the pork belly, good flavor. Also, the fish tasted fresh and I appreciated that they didn't put large mounds of rice as many of the other AYCE places seem to. I generally like just sushi but they appeared to have a variety of rolls and a lot of california rolls for people who prefer to not eat the fish I enjoyed the Green Tea Creme Brulee and would get that again. I didn't catch our sushi chef's name but I would go back to him, he was quite but very attentive and quick. I didn't enjoy some of the loud and obnoxious patrons however that is not the fault of the restaurant.   Overall, if I was in the area I would go back.

      This is my favorite new AYCE sushi place in town!  I love their specials and side dishes, which are more inventive than your average edamame or vegetable tempura.  For side dishes, I loved the grilled pork belly, grilled yellowtail, and spicy tuna on rice crackers. Honestly there wasn't anything I didn't love!  The uni here is the freshest I've ever had in the US.  The menu is very extensive and the fish is all very fresh.  I had the green tea creme brûlée, strawberry mochi ice cream, and lychee sorbet.  I think my favorite dessert was the lychee sorbet.  This is definitely going to be my go to place for sushi from now on!

      Take a seat at the bar and make sure Fredo is your sushi chef. Its the best seat in the house. Of course you are going to do the all you can eat for $27. Order cucumber or seaweed salad, meso soup and edamame to start. You have to try the yellow tail collar, to dies for. If it wasn't limited to one per customer I would eat this all day.  Every roll I had was great. Not bad for a place that has only been open for a few months. finish the meal off with ordering all the desserts! Trust me and Fredo.  Enjoy

      Order everything from their daily special menu if you're adventurous and you'll be rewarded greatly.  If you're not adventurous then go to mcdonalds, jk.  This place is awesome and has all the typical fish you'll see at all of the AYCE places in town.  Definitely do the grilled pork belly like everyone recommends. My faves:  - Super White Tuna - Kobe Beef(1 peice) - Uni  - Halibut - Big Eyed Tuna - Tuna Rice Cracker - Sashimi Salad  Only downside is that its small be prepared to wait.

      Overall, one of the best AYCE sushi joints in Vegas, but disappointed that they didn't have Kobe beef and toro available for us as stated in other yelp reviews.  The quality of fish was what you'd expect for ayce, although there was a huge difference between our orders of hamachi nigiri.  First order was of high quality--nice white, fatty slices with little blood line.  So good I wanted more, but the secound round was rather poor quality--fish was breaking apart like venetian blinds, little fat content and had a large amount of the dark red bloodline. MEH.  I must say their uni and amaebi were both very fresh though. The pork is tasty--simmered for a while till it's melt-in-your-mouth, similar texture to the pork you'd find in a good ramen place.  The spicy tuna on crispy rice was good if you like yaki-onigiri, if you don't then don't get this since it is more rice than fish.  Special rolls we ordered were nothing special, dessert was nice with the green tea creme brulee &amp; green tea ice cream.  Our server was nice, but not very attentive--we had to wait 15 minutes after our first order to put in the 2nd, even with me constantly trying to make eye contact with her.  Are you trained this way to make us full faster????  Overall, "this sushi-mon #2" is a nice addition to our ayce sushi choices here in vegas. If not for a disappointing round 2 of hamachi, so-so service and lack of 2 special items that made me want to try this place, it would have gotten 5 stars.

      This place deserves a 5 star rating. We came to try their AYCE and we were not disappointed. Everything was delish except for the Yakisoba. I thought I ordered a Soba style dish and it wasn't. But what do you expect? This is a SUSHI place for heaven's sake!!

      My review is 4.5 stars.  I still like Sin City better, but there are alot of things to love about Sushi House Goyemon.  Hence the incredible Yelp! reviews for this place.  I would definitely visit this place again.      We sat at the bar.  It was very busy on a Thursday night but there were two open seats, so no wait! Score!  At first, I was a little confused by the AYCE menu and no one explained it right away.  Eventually, one of the sushi chefs explained how it works.    Typically, I eat special rolls and very little nigiri, but not this night.  With the exception of a few things we chose to order, the chefs fed us their picks.  We had a ton of nigiri.  Everything was really fresh and tasty, particularly the mackeral.  The big eye tuna was really good too.  I tried everything Yelpers suggested.  This was my first time having Fried Pork Belly.  Holy crap!  Where have you been all my life?!  Unbelievably good.  A nice layer of charred fat and the mango salsa that accompanies it was the right amount of sweet.  Honestly, everything we tried was good, with one exception:  No matter how much you think you like spicy DO NOT ORDER THE 911 ROLL!  My mouth is still burning!  Thankfully, they offer $13 pitchers of Sapporo to help with the sting.

      A tough week calls for a pick me up dinner. Sometimes I worry about going to a new place with crazy rave reviews as I feel my standards are jilted to high and come out feeling like it was over hyped even if the place is good   I ate words-   like "yum", "oh that's fresh", and "lets get another order".   We really wanted to try all the specials so we started off there.   Today the chalkboard had: Big Eye Tuna- had a richer, tuna taste than regular tuna.  Anago/Saltwater Eel- this was delish. It's softer and less slimy than freshwater and as much as I like unagi, I wish more places would have this.  Japanese Snapper- this was very delicate of a flavor and very fresh. I find some snapper has a very chewy texture and almost muddy taste.  Aji/Spanish Makerel- this was nice. I like the grated ginger on top, but I love gingery stuff.  White Clam- the BF doesn't normally enjoy such thing but even he appreciated the flavor. I thought this was good and must for people who love the chewy nigiris like tako, hokkigai, ika.   Regular nigiri menu: Cajun Albacore- good seasoning. I appreciate that their ponzu sauce isn't overtly citrusy and is much more delicate than other places. There's some places that have that "fake" lime taste and kills all other flavor. Albacore- good and fresh Super White  Yellowtail- buttery in texture- very fresh Mackerel- good, but with the cure+ soy is too salty. 2nd order I asked for ponzu and it was much better this way.   One thing I noticed about the nigiri cuts is that some have a very faint citrus note on it. Not like someone squeezed lemon, but I suspect that they wipe their blades with a citrus water which imparts a hint of it. If you douse your rice in soy, you won't probably taste it, but I barely dip any soy onto my fish. This is something I've seen done in Japan so kudos if that's what flavored it.   Even at my current favorite place, there's some days where certain fish is just okay. Everything today was fresh and on. The daily specials rotating is a great idea since those are intriguing and were all fresh.   I like there is half rolls- we tried the Calico and Ecstacy which are both pretty decent as far as rolls go.   Appetizers:  The famed pork belly was pretty tasty!- Crispy, melty, salty, sweet and tangy balance.  Dynamite- most places but too much mayo. BF liked this and I appreciated it was a bit crispy on top.  Orgasm salad- nice that you get a little sashimi salad action and it wasn't overly dressed or too much greens to fish ratio.  Hamachi Kama- we love yellowtail collars and theirs was good. I wish the skin of it was crispier though....nothing beats when it's like fish skin chips, but only one ayce so far grills it to that (Island).  Grilled Yellowtail- this was on the specials board and was a good piece with some sweet glaze   Dessert: I like that you can get more than just one dessert (though some desserts have a 1order pp limit). BF and I shared the green tea creme brulee, green tea cake and tofu cheesecake. The green tea creme brulee was the winner for both of us. It isn't light on the matcha though so if you don't like the strong green tea taste then it might be a bit much but it is creamy, bittersweet burnt matcha and sugar goodness.   Service was great! That was one that put it over the edge for us. Servers checked on us often, was on top of drinks, had some suggestions and were friendly. It wasn't too busy until the end of our meal and the service didn't suffer just because we weren't the only ones there. The sushi chefs were super nice, funny and personable. We had Tony during the first half of dinner then Fredo came in. Fredo is all jokes and curses. I'm all for it, but just a warning to those who can't handle a fucking joke. I also like the decor in here- definitely one of the nicer ambiance ayces around.   We will be returning soon (and I will be coming sooner for the UYE) ! I feel we might be coming here on a regular and making this our favorite spot if this service and quality stays true.  EDIT- Just wanted to say that the UYE had so many people (25) plus a filled restaurant and our service was still friendly, organized as possible (had separate checks ready for all us) and a reasonable pace on the food. Kudos to the staff! They work really hard here to keep up with the crowd.

      This is a review of their a la carte options.  The Skinny: Although we didn't partake of their AYCE, their a la carte items and bento were below par. FYI - if you do not have their AYCE, the menu and pricing can be confusing (2.5) Service: messed up bill which my hubby had to actually grab a menu and show the waitress that she was wrong (2), Value: given the experience here, I wouldn't come back.(2).  I was enthused to see a highly rated sushi place. So I nagged the hubby to come try this place out. When we arrived. we weren't hungry enough to try their AYCE option. Instead we ordered their deluxe bento (with a side salad and miso soup), katsu curry and a side order of the grilled pork belly.  FYI - if you order a la carte, the prices are all on the actual fold-out menu NOT what's on the AYCE sheet or the supplement page on the placemat. Make sure you check your bill because we were charged for the more expensive price for pork belly (ie, supplement for the AYCE add- on) instead of the a la carte price. The waitress asked the chef instead of checking the menu and didn't believe us. My hubby had to ask for the menu to show her the difference.   The deluxe bento suffered from many problems but let's just start off with the baby upchuck masquerading as some sort of misguided egg salad they put in the top right hand corner. (see pic: http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q&amp;select=pNoiIE--ccKc0V8o2PwRgw) Or perhaps the completely anemic "teriyaki chicken" which didn't even have grill marks on them. The fried salmon and tempura were both soggy. We had to ask for tempura sauce. Sashimi - the fish was cut into thick chunks but isn't cut in the proper matter allowing the fish to melt in your mouth. For what it's worth, the California maki was okay.   There was little to no katsu with the katsu curry.  (FYI - the cutlet in the photo represents about 40% of the entire cutlet which is rather small for $8 see pic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JyxHvtj-syke7m9rbza7mA?select=tl0GrsOs4ViWjApsgaBvog ). The curry itself was overly thick and bland due to the addition of perhaps too much potatoes.  Finally, the grilled pork belly. While the texture of the pork belly was nice, the flavour of the pork was overly smoky for our tastes. The addition of the rather oddly sour tasting mango salsa was a deteriment to the dish. Certainly not something we would order again and we found it expensive for the price.  Overall given our experience with a la carte, we probably won't be stopping by for AYCE. But certainly check your bill if you do decide to do the a la carte tasting.

      I'm jumping on the bandwagon. This place has been getting rave reviews and now I know why. I walked in on a Thursday night and the place was packed. Luckily, one lone spot at the sushi bar was calling out to me.   Everything I tried was good (except for the uni... but I'm just not a fan of it).  Grilled pork belly - Amazing! One of the best pork belly dishes I've ever had... succulent, juicy, tender, crispy edge, perfect amount of fat... It comes with a mango salsa, but it doesn't need it at all. Eating the pork by itself is the way to go.  Uni - I'm not a fan, but wanted to give it another shot since I've only had it a handful of times previously. After trying it here, I still don't like it. It was too salty and texture is not the least bit appealing.  Tuna nigiri - fresh, bright, silky texture, not too much rice.  Moon roll - eel, scallop, tempura flakes. Excellent roll, the eel took a backseat to the distinct flavor of the scallop. And, they didn't over-sauce the roll allowing the flavors of the main ingredients to shine.  Orgasm salad - Didn't quite live up to it's name, but still delicious. Nice bit of heat with the spicy chili sauce.  Spicy tuna crispy rice - Loved the crispy rice and the tuna was excellent. Each piece is big and it comes three to an order.  Hamachi nigiri - Wonderfully fresh, generous cuts of fish. The slices of fish were so big I couldn't even see the rice it was sitting on.  Tofu cheesecake - made in house, this dessert was incredibly rich and creamy.  The service and experience at the sushi bar was great. Chef Fredo took time to talk to everyone and explain the menu even though he, and the other chefs, were slammed. This is one off the strip sushi spot not to be missed.

      Yelp, you never steer me wrong!  The hubby and I went on a Tuesday night and we sat at the bar. We decided on AYCE and that is definitely the way to go. Price is standard at $26.95.   We ordered side dishes first: grilled yellow tail collar, fried calamari, grilled pork belly and baked green mussels. Baked green mussels were good but not nearly as good as Sin City Sushi. We liked everything for the most part but the grilled pork belly is something special. The pork belly was juicy, flavorful and melted in my mouth.  We mostly stuck with nigiri and everything was fresh with not too much rice. The standouts for me were the super white tuna and snow crab meat. Our chef, Mike, suggested a variety of items to try and one of them was rice, raw quail egg and masago wrapped in seaweed. It was surprisingly yummy.   The only roll we had lived up to it's name, Ecstacy Roll. I can't even remember what was in it but it was good! I like that you can do half orders.  What bumped this review up to 5 stars for me were the desserts. The hubby had the green tea creme brulee and I had the tempura ice cream. I wasn't too thrilled with the tempura because it was spongy and not at all crunchy. I did, however, eat most of the green tea creme brulee. It had a good consistency and right amount of sweetness. I still had a little bit of a sweet tooth so I ordered the lychee sorbet. It was so yummy and was a great way to cleanse the palette.   A huge plus was the exceptional service. The sushi chefs were friendly and were gracious enough to suggest different things to try. Our glasses were always full and empty plates were cleared right away.   I am now a believer of the type. I love that they have a frequent punch card. I expect to get that free 10th meal very soon!

      This was the first stop of my Las Vegas Food Tour and wow was it a good one. I have to admit that this was my all time favorite sushi experience and definitely a top 3 overall dining experience.  I chose to sit at the bar (which I highly recommend from now on). I chose to do the AYCE and was flabbergasted by the large selection of nigiri, rolls and special rolls they had. You can add appetizers and desserts to the AYCE as well. Sushi Chef Fredo saw that I was completely clueless about what to order so I basically turned the keys over to him. He basically ordered for me, and I have to say that this is the only way to eat sushi from now on. It was an awesome experience. I also appreciated the way Fredo made the nigiri sushi...he didn't overpower the fish with a ton of rice underneath.  Highlights:  Pork Belly - At first, i thought the soy sauce marinade was gonna overpower the pork belly and make it really salty, but when i ate, it was incredibly delicate and tender. It is similar to chashu. In addition, the pork belly comes with a side of mango salsa to top off the meat. 5/5  Blue Fin Tuna, Toro, and Super White Tuna Nigiri - These were my top dishes for the night. The blue fin tuna was incredibly soft and tender, which makes it just melt in your mouth. It was freakin decadent. I was told that the toro is the belly of the tuna, which makes sense because it tasted fatty and tender...just the way i like it. And the super white tuna (which i've heard is escolar...not tuna) was also really good. It tasted like butterfish. 5/5  Hurricane Roll - the best of the special rolls IMO. It had shrimp tempura and an assortment of other stuff. I think it had rho as well. And it must have been topped with some eel sauce and this other creamy white sauce. I ordered so much, I don't remember what was in it. But i do remember that it tasted balanced and flavorful, and was simply the perfect bite. 5/5  Frying Jason - This is basically a BSCR but the filling had crab sticks and cream cheese. Pretty bomb. 4/5  Grilled Yellowtail Collar - this was also the bomb. you can taste the smokiness from the grill and the fish was light. it felt like you were eating outside your bbq. 4/5  I also ordered:   baked mussels (fantastic)  dynamite (basically the topping of a BSCR in a shell)  orgasmic salad (seared ahi tuna in some greens and lime juice. a bit sour)  jala jala roll (your basic roll with spicy tuna in the filling topped with albacore, salmon, tuna, and a slice of chili pepper....pretty good)  scallop nigiri (it was good, but he put a bit too much lime juice on it)  supreme salmon roll (probably my least favorite. it was a salmon roll topped with salmon. a little overkill)  Finally after all this indulgence, i finished off my meal with some green tea ice cream. delicious.   p.s. all the dishes i ordered can be ordered in half orders.
