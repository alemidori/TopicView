      At Best Average and Nothing Special  Was staying at the MGM and thought dining at the Wolfgang Puck's Bar &amp; Grill would be a good experience. Overall I would say it was average at best and there are many more places with similiar price tags that has better food.  The ambience is what I best remember of the restaurant. It was very hip and very well done.  The problem with the restaurant is the noise level. It is located right in the center of the casino, so the place can get very noisey. If you're looking for a quite dinning experience this not it.   The food here is ok. The planting and presentation is excellent but the food is just ok. Appetizers start at $10 up to $20. Had the grilled chopped vegetable salad and this was the best part of the whole dinning experience. My girlfriend had the pizza and it was ok. Nothing special and had better pizza at my local pizza stop. I had the flat iron steak and that was ok. It wasn't anything special either and just as good as my local stop. The portion size was good to poor. The vegetable salad was enough for two, the pizza was about a 12 inch pizza. The steak was a small amount steak and you had more fries than steaks.  The prices here are about double than most places.   Overall it might be nice for a lunch or to say you've been there but overall nothing special.

      As I've said before, his food doesn't typically impress me but this place was not too bad.  We went here before seeing  the cirque du soleil show in the MGM and the food was good - not outstanding but by no means bad.  The service was wonderful though and that can often be hard to find in touristy areas.  I had the mussels which were delicious, but my girlfriend ordered the ceasar salad and the appetizer crab cakes ($17) for four literally BITE SIZE crab cakes.  Definitely ask about portion sizes because of all five of our meals they were completely across the board.

      YUM. Maybe it was because I had been drinking ALL DAY but seriously, the Flat Iron Steak with Maytag Blue Cheese Butter and French Fries SLAYED ME. Yes I copied and pasted that shizz because I couldn't remember the exact name but anyway! I had a something mojito there that tasted so so so good. I wanted like 3 or 4 more but then they probably would've needed a gurney for me. I am such a sucker for bleu cheese. My friend that was with me ordered pasta that she wasn't so crazy about so maybe it was my prior alcohol consumption that made that red meat taste SO EFFIN GOOD.

      Disclaimer- This review only applies to the bar (no food was ordered)--went here while waiting to get into Ka at MGM.  Specialty cocktails are $10 a piece and have a lot of potential.  That being said, after trying two: The Flirtini (how could I resist?? I love Sex and the City!) and the Pear Drop, I was left disappointed.  Having bar-tended before using the free-pouring method, my bartender here consistently under-poured, despite the generous tips after every round.  Any martini (such as the two I ordered) should not have fruit/sweet n sour as its dominant flavor.  I would have loved to give more stars but when the drinks are weak, what can you say?   How about this: stick to their beer. They have Stella and Newcastle on draft, which alone should warrant a few stars!

      After an early evening arrival in Vegas on Friday, we wanted a relaxed place with good food without going over the top (Had Michael Minna's StripSteak and Bouchon booked for the following two nights).  This place was fine for that purpose.  It is on the casino floor so there is quite a lot of noise, but it didnt detract from the exprience.  My Dad had the burger which tasted great and I had the scallops, seared to perfection and very tender.  My wife had the shrimp risotto which was nice, although a little too rich for her taste.  Mum had the Halibut I think, I cant remember, so it wasn't anything mind blowing.  Wine list was good but not overwhelming, so easy to choose a couple of good ones.  The server was knowledgeable and did help out (which is good because I dont think they had a Sommelier!).  We ordered the Bonaccorsi Pinot Noir which was reasonably priced for wine... and more to the point, for wine in vegas.  (Different experience at StripSteak I can tell you!).   All in all, exactly what I expected for the food and the price to match.

      What the Wolfgang Puck Bar &amp; Grill lacks in creative menu options it makes up for in delicious signature drinks which supply the proper amount of alcohol and have clever monikers like Ginny Hendricks. Since the drink I had here was not the first of the evening, or afternoon rather, my memory of this place is a little foggy. But I do remember cute waiters and cringe-worthy prices. I had gnocchi which did not make me swoon, but the pizza kinda did and so did the chocolate mousse cake. Also, I like the fact that the portions are small. Minimalist decor, but warm and modern, i think the furniture is from ikea, or at the very least some scandinavian country. Its in the middle of the MGM Grand, so check out the tigers while you are there and marvel at mans triumph over nature.

      Location is convenient, but the seating area is open to the rest of the casino.  I hate to taste smoke when I eat.  And all the noise from the casino is still 100% there.  Terribly unpleasant.   The food was OK.  Had the truffled potatoe chips everyone recommended.  Great at first, but too oily and cheesy to eat too much of it.  Pizza was not that spectacular either.

      wolfgang puck is to food like jenny craig is to dieting. everyone knows him. this is the first time i've eaten at one of his restaurants and i was sadly disappointed. the presentation was nice and the service was friendly. (i couldn't tell if the waiter was flirting or just trying to give us helpful hints on the hot spots in vegas.) BUT the food was... fine.   the menu didn't have any stand-out dishes. it was all pretty standard fare, with very few bells and whistles. i ordered the chicken milanese which was pretty much fried chicken breast. eh. our app was steak skewers which were fine, but again... for a chef as well known as puck, i would've expected mouth-watering food.  i would give this place a 3, but with the high expectations and the low delivery, it only receives a 2.

      WATCH OUT WOLFGANG  'Cause your executive chef Dustin Lewandowski just cooked me one of the most amazing freakin' meals I've had in recent memory.  I've eaten here years ago and found the food good, but not amazing.  However, on this night everything was spectacular.    My osso bucco was so succulent I even dug the marrow out of the bone (nasty, huh?) and sopped up every bit of goodness with the creamy Parmesan risotto.  I couldn't help it though. Chef Lewandowski reduced me to a caveman discovering the primal joy of meat meeting fire.    Even my friend's pan roasted chicken was incredible.  When was the last time you had roasted chicken that made you pause after the first bite to marvel at its juicy goodness?  I can't wait to go back.

      A great way to start this past Vegas weekend!  At 8pm, the wait was only 15 minutes.  The three of us started out with pomegranate mojitos, crab cakes and chicken wings.  Everything was delicious!  The butter that came out with the rolls was whipped and creamy and before you know it, we were gobbling up the bread and butter that came to the table.  WHAT A MISTAKE!  Of course we ate too much so that by the time our entrees came out (flat iron steak with fries, rib eye with carmelized cauliflower), we were so full!  Still, that didn't stop us from thoroughly enjoying every last morsel.  Oh, the food was so good....  Our waitress was friendly and quick and my only regret was that I didn't order more mojitos.

      I haven't been to Vegas since March, so it's been a while since eating here, but for some reason - I have no idea why - I was just thinking about the calzone that I get at Wolfgang Puck's every time I go there.  It's probably the best calzone that I've ever had and I've eaten my fair share of calzones.  Perfect crust - not too flaky, not too thick.  Lots of delicious cheese  and plenty of chicken and whatnot.    The first time we ate here we were both hot and tired and cranky and hungry and had wandered around New York New York and the MGM Grand and no food option sounded good.  Finally we decided to try Wolfgang Pucks and we were pleasantly surprised by the outstanding calzone and, of course, the Maytag bleu cheese potato chips.  It instantly made us feel better and we were able to continue on.   I'm a little bummed, I'm hungry for a calzone.  But I won't be back in Vegas for quite some time and it doesn't look like any of the affordable Puck locations in Los Angeles serve them.  Hmmm....must think of an excuse.

      The service was great (thanks Megan) and the food was yummy. We shared two appetizers and the sausage pizza. I had the tuna tartare with fried wonton chips. I would've liked more hot sauce but it was a very nice dish. The shrimp cocktail was great as well and the sausage pizza was yummy and I don't really care for sausage pizzas. My glass of sauvignon blanc was a choice accompaniment for this tasty meal.   My only minor complaint is that even though we only ordered wine, we should have been served water as well. We had to ask for it and it was a little slow in coming.   Much better than I recall the Montana Ave Wolfgang Puck location in Santa Monica, though that was years ago.

      Bread-Pudding-Gasm '07. No shit folks. I would have never have thought that I would be comparing a boring little British dessert like bread pudding to anything related to sex. But, it's true! read on....  Wolfgang Puck had the honor of being my last meal in 2007 and what started out as a seemingly average dinner of Organic Chicken with Garlic Potato Puree and Rosemary Jus, I mean seriously I have that like every night.  My meal was accompanied by a vodka tonic and a nice sauvignon blanc, but it just wasn't enough to make me feel like my last '07 wasn't somewhat disappointing.    Until....dessert.  Imagine how bored I must have felt to pass up chocolate brownies, crme brule and other delectables to settle on bread pudding.  I even gripped about how long it was taking to come out saying that it was just bread pudding and it shouldn't take long.  So imagine my surprise and delight with the king-size portion arrived topped with vanilla ice cream and surrounded by custard and accompanied by an Irish Coffee...mmmmm. At first bite, I knew...this is living!

      I've been here once, but I thought it was great.  I had the Ricotta Gnocchi with Sweet Fennel Sausage Bolognese and it was so light and flavorful, like gnocchi should be.  I honestly don't think I've had gnocchi that good.... ever.  Also, the prices were more reasonable than some of the other options, because if they weren't, trust me, we wouldn't have ended up eating there :)

      Delicious food, but I must've been missing something about this place. It was okay, and I didn't mind the noise coming from being in the middle of the casino. We were seated promptly despite not having a reservation during the lunch hour. The menu is small (one page worth of food) but varied. I ended up getting the prime steak panini and potato salad. Great mix of flavors with the panini and barbeque sauce dip (with a hint of horseradish). The potato salad was probably one of the best I've had...it wasn't too sour and had just enough mayonnaise to keep it rich.   Unfortunately what brought this rating down for me was the service. Slow service. It took a while to get our check, and even longer to get back my credit card. I think I only saw the server once after my food came.

      I have wanted to go to a Wolfgang Puck restaurant and now I did. I'd give it a 3.5 star rating. It was good, not great , casual and simple. I got the signature pizza which was really good I might add. It had a flat thin crust with great tasting olives...great flavor! . The waiter was a bit slow which kinda bummed me out.  I felt like there was nothing to wow me here but for some good food not a bad place. Convenient location.

      Simple and Tasty Bistro in the MGM Grand. We all know Wolfgang Puck by now, and this one is worth pointing out. Great Service and Wine/Beer List. I would recommend the Margarita Pizza. Trendy Decor....a little mini Oasis in the middle of the bustling MGM Casino.

      Finally fresh food in LV. And REAL cheese. After the crappy veg. oil cheese we'd had ever where else the real goat cheese on our salad was divine. The service is attentive, they had liters of Pelligrino, and our pizza was perfect.

      When hanging out at MGM and deciding amongst all the overpriced options for a nice lunch, or low-key dinner, I think this place stands out above the rest. Prices are *fair* and food is very good. I've enjoyed the paninis, particularly the steak one as well as the pizzas. Service is always at least decent. The place is in the middle of MGM so lacks *ambience*, but for an easy lunch/dinner that won't break the bank this place is great.

      Honestly, this place was pretty awful. We stopped there for a late 2pm lunch (pretty normal by Vegas standards). We were hungry, a little hungover, and wanted something close (we stayed at MGM) and good... and we figured it said 'Wolfgang Puck' on the outside so we should be in good hands.  We ordered what was supposed to be fried chicken wings for an appetizer... instead we got these really strange fried bone things. They seriously looked like a fried wontonwith a huge rat bone sticking out of them. And to our surprise, there was supposedly chicken in there mixed in with some strange tasting batter and some sort of vegetable...we couldn't tell. The strangest thing was that on the menu it literally said fried chicken wings, not 'weird mystery meat and vegetable drumstick thing'.   Everything else we ordered was either greasy, oversalted, or just overpriced. Puck needs to either take his name off this place or revamp it. Skip it and eat somewhere else.

      the menu has a delightful selection of food for everyone, including vegetarians. the combinations of flavours in the various dishes is delicious, and their pear drop martini was the only alcoholic beverage of our entire trip that deserves praise. the atmosphere of the restaurant itself  is well done; however, the surrounding casino still penetrates, making a quiet lunch or dinner impossible.

      Thinking of the tuna tartare is making me moist. The menu here, especially the appetizers, is brilliant. This is one of my favorite lunch time restaurants in Vegas.   The atmosphere of Wolfgang's is incredibly trendy. The restaurant is almost all white and features lots of curves. The tables were nice and chairs were pretty comfortable. The menu's were also presented very uniquely as they were posted on a wooden board and held on by a rubber band.   The service was exceptional. Our waiter originally thought they were out of the tuna tartare (I was completely distraught and screamed like a little girl) but then checked and reported to us that they just got a new shipment. Appetizers were served promptly with the entrees coming just as we finished up. My soda glass was always atleast half full.   I definitely recommend the appetizers. I've already mentioned the tuna tartare which is one of the best dishes I've ever had in my life. It's a spicy tuna topped with avocado and served with lightly fried tortillas and a little bit of the most amazing chile sauce I've ever had. Seriously, the thought of the tuna tartare brings my buddy to tears. It's that good.   We also enjoyed the crab cake appetizer which was also quite exceptional.  For my entree I've had the mussels and the fish and chips. The mussels were served in a lemon garlic sauce with foccacia bread. The portions were extremely generous and it was a meal that I enjoyed very much. The fish and chips were disappointing because this restaurant does not have malt vinegar! Luckily the fries were the bomb. You also get one of those mini catsup bottles to impress the ladies.   Overall this is a breathtaking lunch and is highly recommended. Poker comps work here! Get the tuna tartare please.

      I was staying @ MGM and booked an offer then included $35 Dining Credit, asked where I could use it and WPB&amp;G was 1 of them so we (mom and I) decided to go have lunch here after some great pool time...  Ordered a Caesar Salad (shared) and 2 Calzone, they were absolutaly delicious, I highly recommend them!   It's not a fancy place its casual and the service is pretty good.

      The menu is inspired (of course) through and through, and the ingredients and preparation match.  For a while, you can almost forget you're in a windowless casino in the middle of the godforsaken desert.  But only for a moment.  They can have that 5th star when they kick out all the pathetic chain-smoking slot drones and put in some skylights.

      This guy puts his name on anything and lures people in it seems.  The Wolfgang Cafe was OK.  Had the spaghettini and the chicken wing appetizer.  It looks like lamb at first, but it was actually a chicken bone with the meat pushed down.  They try hard, but the tastes are not hitting the spot.  I felt the service had room for improvement.  The food is not terrible here, its average.

      Great food...although a bit on the pricey side.    The portions were decent, the service was wonderful, and the food was very very tasty!    We ate here because we received a thirty dollar dining credit which we used for lunch.  Overall we were very satisfied, although $60 for lunch (including drinks and tip) is a tad bit on the pricey side if you ask me.  (With the dining credit, it turned out to be a very good value)

      This was the most delicious meal I had in Las Vegas! Perfect beet &amp; arugula starter salad that had crunched pistachios on top and CA goat cheese and a citrusy vinaigerette (sp?). For a 'small bites' starter salad it was large enough to share w/ my husband. For my main I had the agnolotti, these wonderful little bite-sized ravioli type pastas that were filled with a tangy artichoke &amp; 3 cheese puree, topped with darling little green clover looking parsley...DELICIOUS! I would definitely eat here again if I ever return to Vegas...My husband had the flank steak topped with a oozey yummy lump of blue cheese and fries...he liked it =). For dessert we shared the 3 sorbet in brandy snaps COVERED in berries....it was SO DELICIOUS. Amazing. My husband had a beer &amp; glass of wine, I had a non-alcoholic Mojito...For all this we got out with a check of $97. Not too bad considering how delicious we found everything to be! The only downside was that our server seemed very harried...maybe he just had too many other tables to wait in his section...he was informative and helpful, just a little distracted/ forgetful. No worries!

      Opted for the burger, and that was a mistake.  I figured, hey, they probably do a kickass gourmet style burger here.  No, it was pretty bad.  Tasted other food and it was fantastic, so I know this was my mistake.  Still...  Service was ok - though they did screw up the birthday surprise for my wife; we had to remind them about it.    Anyway, it's a nice place to eat just before a show.  We went here on our way to Ka.

      Meh - and a serious meh at that.  I'm not sure how much I really need to write about this place, partially because everything was so extremely unmemorable. Though it was a relatively good kickoff for the rest of the trip.  Ordered a few things split between my girlfriend and myself. 2 different wood fired pizzas, and a bowl of corn puree soup.  1. Garlic Chicken pizza. - Decent crust, toppings were a bit cold, though meshed well together.  2. Goat cheese and shaved fennel pizza. - Pretty much the same thing can be said about this, decent flavor with the toppings, though pizza was a bit cold as well. 3. Corn puree soup. - This was actually really decent. I liked this a lot, even though it had red peppers in it. The flavors did not detract, it was very sweet. Very good soup. Crust from the pizzas went really well with that soup.  Service was extremely slow, however, it was 4pm in the afternoon. Slightly disappointing that it took us 30 minutes to get the pizza, and then it came out cold. Not really happy about that.  3 stars - Overall, passable if you feel like quick cafe type food. But not worth it as a destination visit while in Vegas.
