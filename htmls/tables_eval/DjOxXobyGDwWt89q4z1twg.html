      There's an authentic ramen place in Las Vegas! I was really impressed with Monta Noodle House. Their menu is very simple and short. I tried the Tonkotsu Ramen and it was delicious! All this pork fatty goodness in the broth and the noodles were perfectly cooked not too soggy not too hard. You can add an egg, pork, corn, more noodles or green onions for a couple more bucks. It's a small place which only fits about 26 people max, but it definitely is the best place for ramen. The broth is not from a package and I think this is what makes it oh so delicious. We added eggs to ours, but I wasn't that huge of a fan. The egg was too "raw" for me, but the bf loved it.  The bf also ordered the mini mentaiko bowl, which is rice with cod roe. I didn't try it, but he liked it and the eggs are a lil more fishy than masago. Definitely coming back for more and be prepared to be a lil sweaty when you eat!

      Hakata style Ramen originates in northern Kyushu.  It is in my opinion the best ramen you can get, with maybe Kurume being at the same level. Start with a thick pork broth made with boiled pork bones to release the collagen into the soup.  Next, add some of the best noodles I've ever tasted.  throw on some basic toppings like roast pork, green onions, mushrooms and bamboo, and that's your standard bowl.  They also have one with miso. The menu here is very simple.  There are the two bowls of Ramen, and additional toppings, then there are a few small rice dishes (mostly fried rice with some topping), and pot stickers. Everything is amazing, be it service, staff, taste, decor.  There is not a good enough rating to describe this place. Come on in today, and look for them next to Raku, and say hello to your new favorite restaurant.

      Dropped by today after Googling ramen in Las Vegas and eventually found this new ramen-ya on Spring Mountain (it is in the same plaza as Raku).  Read the raving positive reviews posted on Google and also by Rod M., and I decided that I will resume my thus far unsuccessful search for a decent or better ramen place in Las Vegas.  After driving in the still very warm heat to the restaurant, I saw about 6 Asians standing or sitting outside the restaurant.  I was thinking, damn word sure got out fast for these Vegas Yelpers, but it turns out that they weren't waiting for this particular eatery.  Anyway, I went in and immediately saw that it is a very cozy and nicely decorated (I would describe it as very modern Japanese minimalist) restaurant with seating for 18 at the tables, and another 10 at the bar.  There is a small board hanging on the wall, on the right as you enter the restaurant, listing a few specials items not on their very simple menu (see the photo that I have uploaded).  I decided to order their Tonkotsu "pork bone" Ramen and add a side of Nitamago (hard boiled egg seasoned with soyu).  The ramen was prepared in a very clean and small kitchen, which you can clearly see if you are seated at the bar.  The ramen was served in an average size bowl, not small but definitely not large and probably just right for most people.  The broth was piping hot, the noodle cooked just right, and garnished with a small mound of green onions and two thin slices of their melt in your mouth chashu. I first tried the broth, which has a good depth of pork flavor and not too salty or greasy or water down like at some of the other local ramen places that I have tried on the East side of town.  The noodle was the thin variety, which is not my preference, but it was cooked just right.  Overall, it was a good bowl of ramen and definitely the best I have had in Las Vegas. But to Jeff and my other ramen connoisseur friends, it is not as good as the really awesome and highly regarded ramen served at Santouka Ramen (Torrance, California) or Santa Ramen (San Mateo, CA), but still worth a try when you guys are in town.  I also ordered a Mini Mentaiko Bowl, which was served with a decent amount of rice.  Mentaiko rice bowl is nothing special, and not difficult to prepared, but it was delicious because it was made with fresh and quality ingredients.  The staff were very friendly and the waitress, Megumi, was very attentive.  It wasn't busy at the time of my visit (just one other customer who was already there before I arrived), but I can see that this place starts to get more crowded as word spread of their good quality soupy goodness for a reasonable price.  Tonkotsu Ramen $6.95 + Nitamago           $1.50 Mini Mentaiko Bowl  $2.95  To the owner(s):  I recommend that you consider adding chicken karaage to the menu or as a special.

      I went here on a recommendation from a work friend.  I am blown away by this place.  It is like the holy grail from Tanpopo.  This movie is amazing and it's about foodie ramen culture in Japan.  They are as authentic as it comes.  Just like the movie, the ramen is cooked al dente, the pork slices are placed carefully, the soup is hot and the broth is flavorful.  All the toppings are there and we were so excited we replicated a part of Tanpopo when the zen ramen master mindfully eats his ramen.    I knew this place was it when I ate everything and drank the broth to the bottom of the bowl.  The soft boiled eggs are a must.  This place is amazing and the menu is simple and they just added the shoyu ramen which is by far my favorite.  the shoyu ramen is light broth not overly salty, the tonkatsu is very meaty and flavorful and they use a different noodle.  I prefer the ramen noodles that come with the miso ramen though.  The miso ramen is delicious but, a little to salty (but, authentic for japanese taste)  I wouldn't get their gyoza again.  pretty generic and expensive.  the ramen is cheap coming in at under $7 for the tonkatsu and $8 for the miso.  This place is damn good.  I went their for dinner and was so impressed I went back for lunch again the next day driving all the way from Henderson.    Monta is pretty authentic looking and I hope it does well because I love little hole in the wall gems.

      The Skinny: pretty good Hakata styled ramen (2.75), efficient service (3), value - really good... only $6.95 for a good ramen pick-me-up (4).  Tried this place because my hubby needed a big bowl of warm Japanese love after working all day and because of the Yelp reviews. We were super excited to see that this place specializes in Hakata-style pork broth ramen.  Hmmm... well... so far, it's one of the best bowl of ramen we've had in Vegas (but that doesn't necessarily say much). There is certainly a good amount of porky flavour in the broth... but not enough to make it really stand up  on its own (ie, make me want to drink the whole bowl and wonder if I can ask for more).  Also, there is a hint of the distinctive earthy shitake mushroom which does take away from the flavour of the pork.  The noodles are classic tonkotsu ramen noodles but they lacked the nice chew of others we've tried. The chashu was okay - a little on the fatty side, mildly tough but great flavour.  Overall, it's not bad, it's closer than LA (which has some really great ramen establishments), and pretty good value for your money.

      Finally.  A shop in Las Vegas specializing in Japanese Ramen and Monta does it quite well.    Great space, simple and clean with a counter overlooking the kitchen.  The menu is straightforward.. two types of ramen, TONKOTSU Ramen and MISO Ramen.  Then there are a few extra topping options such as a flavored soft boiled egg, and cha-shu.  In addition, they have a few rice dishes like the pork belly bowl, chashu bowl and a mentaiko bowl.   The TONKOTSU RAMEN is really good.  The pork broth/soup has great flavor... dense, rich , almost creamy.  "Umai" would be the Japanese expression to describe this taste.  The "men"  (noodles) were thin, typical of this style of ramen.. but I would've liked them to be a bit more hard or al dente as the italians would call it.  The cha-shu was good too.    Hope everyone is excited to welcome this great new ramen shop to this city as much as I am..

      Who reins supreme in ramen in Vegas?  Monta Ramen!  I've been dreaming about a fantastic ramen-ya in Vegas for years ever since trying greats like Daikokuya in LA.  Finally, the time has come and we can have a legit ramen-ya in Las Vegas.  The place is in a small suite that is simply and tastefully decorated, and I think that is reflected in its menu where it is also simple.  They only concentrate on a ramen and a few side dishes.  To me, I think that is a sign of a great restaurant.  Breaking it down =) 1.  Tonkotsu Ramen - True to its description, the soup was hearty, full flavored porky fatty goodness!  The chashu was not for the fatty-faint of heart.  These fatty bad boys had a flavorful full fat ring around the slice.  I also think the takenoko (bamboo shoots) and kikurage (black fungus) added a nice contrast of crunch and earthy flavors.  I agree with other yelpers that the noodle is good, but I would prefer a more al dente touch.  Regardless, I slurped up the entire bowl of noodles like a professional Japanese business man.  The. Entire. Bowl.  Slurp! 2.  Gyoza - Nothing too fantastic.  I think half of them lacked the critical yummy juice factor because the skin had popped when frying them.  Conclusion:  Bomb-tastic hole in the wall ramen-ya in Vegas.  Just based on ramen alone = 5 stars!

      This place was sooo hard to find because they had no sign.  If my friend didn't tell me it was right next to Raku I wouldn't have found it.  It was worth it though.  Much like In-n-Out there is a very small menu but the quality and simplicity made up for it.  I am a fan!

      The noodles were definitely decent in Vegas. We tried the tonkatsu and miso ramen. Miso ramen was too salty for me. Miso is such a strong taste that you should not have that first before you tried the tonkatsu one. The noodles they used for this was perfect(it was the ramen noodles)!  Tonkatsu ramen was really tasty. The pork melted in your mouth. So good! The fungus gave the ramen a crunchy/texture to it! You always want to have some sort of bamboo in your ramen, which they did! The only thing I thought was missing was the noodles. They served mines with the thin noodles. I preferred to have my ramen with ramen noodles! I don't know if they are out of those ramen noodles or that's what they served but I'll have to request that next time. Yes, there will be a next time! :) Overall, it was pretty delish!

      Oh yay! I still love Monta! I've been back three times since my first review. Tonight was the first time I tried the Miso Ramen. Let me tell you, it was delicious! The noodles were actually ramen and the soup was a lil sweet. It was definitely not a disappointment at all. I can't wait for the winter, when its ramen eating weather! However, there was a weird smell inside but other than that the food was still awesome.

      I'm new to the world of authentic ramen. Ever since my cousin suggested I watch a silly little film called Ramen Girl, I've been wanting to give it a try. I thought I would have to go to NYC or LA to get my Ramen fix, so I was completely stoked when I heard about this place through a friend.  From the existing reviews, it sounded like I needed to try the Tonkotsu Ramen. I'm glad I did because it was absolutely delicious. The broth is amazing and all the ingredients worked together to provide a satisfying ramen experience. Of course, I had to add egg because that's just my thing.  My cousin also ordered a Mini Pork Belly Bowl. The pieces of meat looked like bacon, but they were soft and tender. It's a delicious side dish that complemented the hot bowl of soup. I will definitely return.

      Thank you fellow Yelper"s for helping me find my new favorite ramen restaurant in Las Vegas Monta Noodle House.   The place is a hole in the wall place and has only been in business for a month now, but don't let that hold ya back! The place is clean with awesome service.   I went with the Tonkotsu Ramen that's the BOMB! The soup is so tasty and pork is perfectly cooked.   The ramen is as good if not better then some of the ramen joints in So Cal. I'll definitely be returning here in the future.

      I went asap after reading Mike C's review!  This is by far the best ramen I've had in Vegas but this would maybe only be a 3 star place if it were located in Japan. Its certainly a 4+ star place in LV.    We both got the tonkotsu ramen which was pretty good although more miso-y than I expected.  I got the extra chashu which was great and pretty different than other chashu I've had as it had more of a roasted taste.  The gyoza was just ok.  My wife (Japanese) was disappointed w/ the quality of the noodles but we'll take what we can get outside of Japan.    This certainly beats the hell out of the prices of Yokohama Kaigenro and I am psyched its so close to my place.    I'm more of a shoyu ramen guy which is what I'll get next time.

      A 3 star elsewhere but for LV a solid 4.    Worthy comfort food and a change from the other 5 star dining over a weekend of debauchery over the 4th of July.

      Still going here every week if not more often. They finally have a sign up so they're a bit easier to spot. Anyway, I'm glad everyone else is liking this place.  I don't know why the bad reviews on the gyoza, because it's right up my alley.  And yes, they do use different noodles for the Tonkotsu ramen versus the others.  The tonkotsu ramen is Hakata style, and is known for the very thin, very delicious noodles.  They cook theirs a little more here than they do in Hakata, but it's still great. Anyway, having tried the miso ramen, I'd say give this one a shot too.  It's their tonkotsu soup with miso added to give it a rich nutty flavor that really sticks to your ribs. I also have to recommend the chahan (fried rice), it is super peppery and delicious.  Just the way I remember it from my highschool days in Japan. A second note.  Anything you don't like on your ramen, let them know.  I keep going with picky eaters (1 vegan, others just picky), and they've made a vegan kimchi chahan, as well as bowls of ramen with extra this, no that, whatever you ask for. As always, they're eager to please, and definitely worth seeing, so help Monta stay busy, and maybe even expand.  I would love to see more of these guys.

      Having lived in OKinawa AND in mainland Japan, in Yokosuka... i'd like to think that I know a thing or two when in comes to Japanese Ramen.   Before there was Monta, there were only two real places to get Ramen here in Vegas. One was Togoshi (which sadly had closed) and Kaigenro (which still has some pretty excellent ramen, BTW). Enter Monta...a fresh new take on a small niche market here in sin city.   And let me tell you, after that first sip of the soup and the first snap of the fresh noodles, I was instantly transported back to Japan. Even for just a fleeting moment, I forgot all about the hustle and bustle of day to day life here and was "home" for the duration of a bowl or ramen.   Their chashu is out of this world!  the menu is kept simple with three main variations of ramen: shoyu, miso, and tonkotsu...all of which are absolute trips back in time, like being back in Japan.   Now only if they served beer...........

      "Got Ramen?"  My life has never been the same ever since I became lactose-intolerant. I've tried to substitute with soy milk to no avail. Now thanks to Monta, I can drink Tonkatsu broth all-day to get my nutrients! Yes, Tonkatsu broth, rich, creamy pork marrow. Served with slow roasted pork in pork fat. Topped with green onions. I wish I drank this growing up, I would have been 6 foot-tall and playing in the NBA. Instead, I'm short and pull people's teeth for a living.   My one complaint, turn up the AC yo! It is HOT! I was sweating more than the pig I just ate. I was sweating like a hooker in church. Like junkie in withdrawal. Like Clinton next to an intern. Like a blonde reading a math book. Seriously Chuck Norris would complain that it's hot in there..

      Before everyone gets carried away this started off as a strong 4 star review because I was stoked that we finally had decent ramen in Vegas. That other place Togoshi that closed down was not even remotely worth mentioning. I apologize but you people are really reaching. I'm not going to name drop, but there are GREAT ramen-ya in California and New York as well as some not so good ones in the mix.   Monta....I was willing to over look a few things. Like the fact that it's 103 degrees outside at night and you have no working A/C. Also the faint smell of sewage doesn't really get your appetite going as you walk through the door. Let's serve a steaming hot bowl of ramen in the middle of the Las Vegas summer with no adequate ventilation except for some ceiling fans.   Let's pretend I'm part Asian even part Japanese and I know something about food. Yes the food is decent and the ramen, pork belly and boiled egg, noodles are decent. Not the greatest but good enough that I would have returned. Prices are reasonable until you start getting extras. Our bill was $44.00 for the 2 of us. Pretty respectable check average for a small establishment.   This is where I am not understanding how you could overlook simple customer service. I have reasonable expectations of decent food and decent service....   Whoever the arrogant F**K is that owns Monta:   1. This is not Japan   2. We live in the year 2010.   3. There are not enough Japanese here in Las Vegas a town dominated by the Chinese, Koreans, Vietnamese and every other nationality that you can afford to lose business.   4. Treat your customers better.   5. You might as well save some money and switch to walk-up counter service because that's about how useful your waitress was.   It was not so much a lack of experience or lack of training issue, but more an arrogant I don't care it's not my job mentality and attitude. What? You don't think I saw this in Japanese restaurants 20 years ago? Even the Chinese have changed Mr. Bakatari and deliver with much more friendly and caring service. Is it that hard??   I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with tamago, extra pork and extra noodles. They serve the extra noodles on the side in a bowl and later I find out why. YES YES YES I know broth is costly, labor intensive and time consuming to make. But if you order XTRA noodles then the ration of broth to noodles should be proportional. It was not even close. I asked the waitress, Miss Personality very politely if I could have a little extra broth as I had a ton of extra noodles and no broth left. I'm not complaining, there wasn't that much broth to start with just enough for the regular order of noodles I was served. Answer was "no". No big deal I will pay for extra broth just a tiny bit, whatever you guys want to charge....fat sumo kitchen lackey is like f'****n way and again "no" then a half ass sorry as she is walking away.   Honestly this is such a joke I've been to restaurants in LA and again NY that have the name and ability to be arrogant and pretentious yet the service is warm and hospitable.   You can go to Naked Fish, owned and operated by Japanese, yet the service is outstanding.

      Nice place!  They are always eager to please their customers.  The food is tasty.  I love the hiyashi chuka, kimchee fried rice, and an iced green tea.    I feel like such a fatty after walking away each time, but it's damn good food.  Will visit again and again.

      After stumbling through various Japanese restaurants that serve decent bowls of ramen, I've finally found a place that specializes at it. In fact, it's pretty much all they serve. Their menu reminded me of an In-N-Out menu: You either order a tonkotsu ramen or a miso ramen. If you don't want ramen, there's fried rice and some basic Japanese apps. Not much in terms of variety. But, if this is what you're in the mood for, they do it great.  I started off with an order of gyoza for an app. Simple stuff and what you'd expect. Nothing to write home about. Then, came the steamy bowl of tonkotsu ramen. The broth was a real winner here. A lot of places that I have tried never really got the broth quite right. This was one place where the flavor really hit the spot. Even though it's a scorching 100+ degrees outside, a routine stop for a bowl of ramen here is worth having. Next time I drop by, I will probably give their fried rice a shot.  Monta is a tiny, quaint little place, though not very crowded when I went. It started out empty when we walked in, but started filling up as we were slurping up our noodles. I wouldn't expect a wait for a table, but I could see it happening if this place picks up in popularity.

      One Saturday afternoon, I finally had a chance to try Ramen @Monta Noodle House. Right after I entered the noodle shop, all the employees were shouting loudly in Japanese usual expression in turn: Irasshaimase, Irasshaimase! I felt so welcomed :p   So, I decided to try the 'Tonkotsu' with boiled egg since it was one of their special dishes &amp; highly recommended by the server. She brought some of the minced garlic and pickled ginger with it.  Without hesitation, I put a little bit of garlic in the soup just because I love garlic so much :)  I could totally taste of very rich and milky pork bone broth in my mouth. The noodle was very thin and straight. One of the toppings that really stands out was the sliced pork, the 'Chashu'. It was very tender and soft.  Overall, I was happy with the Tonkotsu Ramen but, I liked the Miso Ramen with lots of bean sprouts @Shuseki little better. If someone wants to try richness of the broth &amp; the amount of oil they want, the Tonkotsu Ramen is the one...  Next time, I still want to try their Kimchi Fried Rice &amp; Cold(chilled) Noodle(Hiyashi-chuka).   On my way out, I heard, " Arigatoh Gozaimashita!" Once again, they were thanking customers and I was pleased with the service @Monta!!!

      After reading about Monta here on Yelp, I was in the general area on Sunday, 7/18/10, after learning another resto was closed on Sundays.  THIS PLACE IS SMALL. It seats 26 people. So, depending on your group size, it may be a bit difficult to get everyone in.   I got there at 2:15pm, and it was 114 degrees outside in the wonderful Las Vegas heat. Monya has -no- air conditioning, except for a single box fan near the front door. Which, by the way..does nothing but blow the freaking scorching air outside INSIDE. That really really sucks.  How was the ramen, you wonder? It was good.  The rich tonkotsu broth was addictive, but the chashu was waay too thinly sliced for my liking. (but was very tasty) AWESOME marinated soft-boiled egg that will haunt my dreams for days to come.  I was the only whitey there that afternoon, and my service was excellent. I sat at the counter, watched the chefs do their thang, and the shitty heat aside, I enjoyed my lunch there.  It totally did remind me of the little ramen-ya's i've eaten at in Japan, tho. it was so small on the inside. The place was packed to full capacity (all 26 of us idiots eating boiling hot ramen on a boiling hot day in Vegas.)   I will take my husband here, as I know he'll like the ramen. But, he'll hate the lack of air-conditioning, and the fairly limited menu items. Going across the street to Shuseki gives you so many more Japanese food choices that are great, plus the place is big and comfy inside.  Kaigenro makes an awesome mabo ramen that beats all Vegas ramen.  Good, but not the best ever.

      On my first visit to the Monta (Ellis) Noodle House I had an inclination that it was worthy of four sexy stars. After eating here, I'm quite certain of that.  Your not going to drive past it on Spring Mountain in case you think you missed it because it's all the way in the back of the plaza.    If your a Rameniac like myself.  This place is the new kid on the block and a must-try.  We know Las Vegas isn't exactly a hot-bed for ramen but Monta meets my needs.  The Miso Ramen was delicious, it's probably one of the best in town. we waited 15 minutes, but definitely worth the wait. although many have first timers have said it wasn't worth.  Monta wouldn't stand a chance vs. some ramen spots I frequent in the Bay Area. But all of my friends and they were all asian said it couldn't be better.  The kikurage was yummy as well.  But stay away from the specials like the Kim-Chi Fried Rice.  But who the hell goes to a ramen house for fried rice?  Duh!

      Hello, my name is Anthony, and I'm a ramen newbie.  Outside of the thirty cent packages you make at home, I've never had ramen at a proper restaurant until I went to Monta.  Boy, have I been missing out...  The three main soups they offer are the tonkatsu, miso and shoyu broths.  I've had both the tonkatsu and miso soups and have enjoyed both, but don't understand why they have different noodles.  The miso has what I thought to be "traditional" ramen noodles, while the tonkatsu had a plain looking light colored noodle.  I like the tonkatsu broth, and the miso noodles; according to other Yelpers you can have them make your soup with that broth/noodle combination.  Just one more reason for me to go back!  The pork that is served with the soup is like no other pork I've had before.  For the longest time the only time I would eat pork is if I were at a Vietnamese restaurant; now Monta joins that exclusive club.  The pork is very soft and I felt that the texture goes great with soup; however at my last visit another person in our group said that it should be more firm.  Like I said, I'm a ramen newbie, but for now I sure do love my Monta.

      After all the hype that I've been hearing about monta, i finally got to try it.  This place is probably the best ramen house in vegas.  The noodles are very different and definitely not like any ramen you make at home.  The broth is my favorite and the best part to me.  I got the tonkatsu and you can really taste the pork flavoring in the soup.    They only give you 2 pieces of pork which was not enough for me since they were so tasty.  You can add an additonal 4 peices for 2.50 i believe, but if you do so, the whole thing will come out to around 10-11 bucks.  Which was a little pricey for what its worth.  Service was friendly but the restaurant didn't have AC and their fan didn't cut it with this 110 weather.  I'll probably revisit this place in the winter 12039023 times but as for now, its WAAAY to hot to eat ramen.  It was hard debating between giving it a 3 or a 4.  If i could, id definitely rank it a 3.5, mainly because of the fact that its just ramen and it didn't make me wanting to come back for more.

      A quaint Japanese noodle house packing big flavors best sums up Monta. The place  is reminiscent to the noodle houses we frequent in Torrance, CA and Litte Tokyo, offering a simple menu that doesn't detract patrons from the restaurant's main dish: ramens. We opted to try the miso ramen (bean paste) and tonkotsu ramen (pork bone) with the addition of available toppings such as chasu (roasted pork -- not for the fat conscious eater), shredded green onions, and butter (yes, butter!). The third ramen offering, shoyu, is something we'll probably try on the next go. The noodles were chewy-soft and a bit firm which is how it should be, and with a flavor-rich broth that's a cross between creamy melted butter and meaty-savory -- a feat only possible with many hours of high heat infusion of the ingredients. On a hot summer day, the place suffers from the lack of a good a/c, but once you start chowing down your piping hot ramen, the warm ambience fades into obscurity. A definite must-try place that we're glad we stumbled upon!

      Allright, I went back for lunch today to Monta. It was 3:45 in the afternoon, and it wasen't busy like last Sunday. Therefore, it wasen't as ungodly hot and stifling inside as it was last time.  I ate the whole bowl of ramen AGAIN. I have begun to really grasp just WHAT makes the tonkotsu ramen so good. It's savory and not overly salty. In fact, it's UN-ramen-like in that regard. (OK, i'll admit to normally eating a shoyu-based one many many times) The broth is actually a bit creamy (VERY addictive) and the stuff inside the bowl is tops.  Can I tell you how much IN LOVE with the marinated boiled/almost soft egg in it, AKA nitamago? It's so damn great! If you like hardboiled or softboiled egg, you'll love it I guarantee.  I have to try the fried rice and their gyoza. They smell very very good, but I have to have more people with me to get it all eaten! When the weather cools down, i'm going to be here LOTS!  BTW, they have a VERY funky restroom!

      I read about this restaurant on Yelp and was very excited to find a good ramen place.   As all the other Yelpers mentioned, it is VERY warm in the restaurant so be prepared! The whole restaurant only fits about 26 people but we were lucky we were the only customers.  I went with my boyfriend and I ordered the tonkatsu ramen w/ egg and he had the miso w/ corn, egg &amp; extra chashu. Even in the heat I definitely enjoyed the ramen. The broth was very savory and delicious. The chashu was very soft and also very flavorful. I would definitely order the extra chashu next time we go there. I've never had corn in my ramen before (except for the american cuponoodles) but it added a nice crunch to the dish and sweetness.  The service was good but just be careful with your bill there. This was the first time we went there and they rang up 3 cokes instead of 2. After the transaction was completed she had corrected it by giving us cash back for the misrung item. After leaving the restaurant and being a day later, we came to realized the server charged his debit card TWICE for the meal as well. So not only did they rang up extra items on our tab but they charged the transaction TWICE.  Keep in mind that we were the only people in the restaurant as well so it wasn't like it was very busy.   Overall I was happy with the meal, just will keep in mind to pay cash and triple check the tab from now on.

      What a great place. The Tonkotsu was delicious and that boiled egg made it all work together. How they get the broth to have so much body and soul is beyond me but it make for so really delicious Ramen. Go at night as its not so hot AC seems to be broke but go because its delicious.
