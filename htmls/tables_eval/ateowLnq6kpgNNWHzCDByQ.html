      Totally awesome place to enjoy some unique cocktails and amazing bites! Everything from the won-tacos to the Greek salad is mouthwatering. Service staff is very upbeat and friendly. Great outfits and a super energetic bar staff. A must to visit while in Vegas!!!!!

      Went on opening night, nervously anticipating the staff's performance. We were greeted at the door around 9pm and told there may be a wait of up to 2 hrs. They took our phone number to send us a text when our table was ready. Only about 40 min later we got the text. So things were looking better already.   The staff was very attentive. We had a waiter and a backup the whole night. Guy was there too. Heard him give a great pep talk to the staff in the kitchen before he came around to the tables to see the guests.   On to the food...big portions. Great takes on traditional stuff. We had the drunken fish tacos. 4 smaller tacos with fresh grilled tilapia, slaw radishes avocado slices , corn salsa and limes. Excellent! Served on unique wooden platters and chrome stands. Awesome presentation.   We also got the famed macaroni and cheese bacon burger. A piled high burger big enough for 2 with seasoned fries. While they didn't ask how well I wanted the burger done, it came out medium well to well. That's good for me. The Mac and cheese addition was over the top.   A good beer selection of craft brews and the old standby, PBR. We didn't get any cocktails, but they all appeared to be original creations for this restaurant.   Reasonably priced. Great service. Fun environment. Option of indoor or patio seating.  I think Guy has another hit here.

      I'm a big fan of Guys, my boyfriend and I went there opening night. The staff was really nice but I think they had to be because Guy was there lol. The food was OK.... It wasn't nothing to ride home about... Your better off going somewhere off the Strip, like Nicked City Pizza....

      We came across Guy Fieri's brand new Vegas restaurant after seeing a show. It was a perfect late night snack. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They have some great looking Vegas Fries but when one of our party asked if we could get just plain fries they said sure. Our Server, Nichole, was very friendly along with her helper. I hope the level of service keeps up as the restaurant moves forward.

      The Mac n cheese bacon burger is one of the best I've had.  Fondue dippers are awesome.  Ambiance is great, menu had plenty to offer, and service was top notch.  Ask for Bria she was great! Food is reasonably priced, and don't forget your Total rewards card, they discount.

      I just had the pleasure of eating at Guy's Vegas Kitchen &amp; Bar.  The food was amazing.  I highly recommend the Triple T fries.  The white truffle cream dip is to die for.  I am so glad I do not live in Vegas.  I would be dining at Guy's every night.

      Came here after seeing some promos for it just opening. Pretty cool vibe to it, with a mix of music from the outside carnival court and music inside. A little loud for my liking but I get it. Really friendly staff all around. I had the mac and cheese burger and it was really good. Huge portions of everything!! Wife had the the asian wraps and the pepperoni sticks. The asian wraps came out cold. I will try it again down the road. Overall a decent place for some good food.

      Had lunch with the family here for the first time and was better than expected! We all ordered a different dish and were all pleased with the presentation and quality of the food. Prices are reasonable for the quality and relaxing atmosphere. We will definitely return again. The Staff was really cool and made sure you were well taken care of.

      My girl friend and I stopped in here to grab a bite to eat for lunch and were not disappointed. She got the turkey burger and I got the Mac n' Cheese burger. Both were very delicious and full of flavor. The sandwiches came with "variety" fries which were seasoned very well. For being a new restaurant and the strip and celebrity themed I would say that the prices were very fare.   No problem with the service. Received some suggestions for the menu which seemed a little to "scripted" and not genuine. Only problem we had was when we were asked where we wanted to sit we asked for inside and ended up getting put right next to the large open doors, which made it a little chilly and not feel like we were inside since it was windy out.   Overall good food, prices, and service. Would suggest if you are looking for a place that offers a good burger and fries

      The service, food, and staff were amazing!  I went here with my family, party of four, during the pre-soft opening where our whole meal was comped. We were instantly greeted and shown our table. Although, we weren't seated at the bar, the bartenders made us feel welcome as we passed by.   The service was quick and they managed to make conversation despite being packed. My glass was never empty and the servers were kind.   We ordered the Big Dipper, Triple T fries, Nachos Del Jefe, General's Wings, Margarita Fajita Wings, and Victor's Sweet Tacos. And for dessert we had the Triple Doublemint Pie. We were huge fans of the Margarita Fajita wings, the amazing truffles smothered all over the Triple T fries, Nachos Del Jefe and the Big Dipper.   The sauce for the Margarita Fajita wings was phenomenal. They almost took this off the menu, but we are so glad that they didn't. It was a sweet and sour sauce with herbs accompanied with perfectly cooked chicken. So worth it!   My brother loved the Nachos Del Jefe. Everyone else at the table enjoyed it, but didn't believe that it was "spectacular".   Everyone at the table loved the Triple T fries. There were truffles over the fries and within the sauce. There was so much, we couldn't possibly finish all of it, because the portion size was HUGE (which is a great thing).   The Big Dipper was a great sandwich. The manager came by to inquire about our experience and he informed us that they spent hours cooking the meat to perfection. It was seasoned well, and moist. It's a must try!   Overall, we enjoyed the food, service and staff. The managers even came by a couple times to personally talk and make us feel welcome while the servers were friendly and consistently checked on us in a pleasant manner.

      We had Asian wrap appetizers and had two of the sandwiches the pulled pork and the roast beef,. Sandwiches were hot and the appetizer was really good and tasty. Love the fries cause it's a combination of four different types, waffle, crinkle, sliced and shoestring very good! Will come back again....

      My husband and I dined at Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen and Bar last Friday evening. The manager Michael welcomed us, and the hostess took us to a nice table.   First I like to mention the Ace Perry Cider that I ordered. That will be my forever favorite! What an awesome taste, especially in combination with the tasty menu items!   We ordered the Guy-talian Fondue Dippers and the Righteous Rojo Rings for an appetizer. We loved it, and couldn't get enough! Finally something different! American food but infused with worldly flavors! Awesome! We love Chili, so we had to try the Southern Smothered Chili Bowl! The cornbread on top with the sour cream, yummy! We give it a 5star! Another one of my favorite are the Fireball Whiskey Wings. The blue-sabi sauce that comes with it is divine!  The fries! OMG! The best fries I ate in the United States for sure. They come in different sizes and styles... a must try!   I especially like the unique way the food is presented. Each menu item has a different kind of set up. I love eating with my eyes, and I was satisfied for sure.  Big compliment to the entire staff! Everybody is in a great mood, happy and helpful! They sure know what the menu items are, and explain it well.   This was my third visit to Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen and Bar, and it definitely became one of my favorite American restaurant within one week!

      Food: I loved everything we ordered, we were looking for late night food and this place was perfect. I had the Motley q sand which, which is not just any pulled pork sandwich, it was loaded with tender chunks if meat that melted in your mouth with a fun slaw, awesome sauce, and melted wonderful cheddar on a toasted pretzel bun. Yum! Served with 4 kinds of fries, all of them amazing.  Ambiance: what you would expect from Guy, it had personality, not formal, and the wait staff were coordinated, but not in a kitschy way.  service: and this is why I gave them a 3 star rating was spotty at best. It took 20 minutes to get drinks, then easily took 30 minutes to get our check after they took our plates. Very strange, but the back up staff kept up with refills, so that was nice.

      Watch out everyone Guy Fieri's back in town not as a UNLV student but as a Restaurateur! This time he's taking no prisoners -- well, no chefs -- because Chefs Bobby Flay and Gordon Ramsay should be quivering and quaking in their boots because, by far, Guy has the best burger in Vegas, especially with the BBQ Bourbon Sauce.  My wife, 11-year-old daughter, and I had an Italian themed day in Vegas. We  went to Mob Museum (Daughter thought one of the mobsters looked like Actor Robert DeNiro), Rode on a Gondola at the Venetian, went to a Gun Range, and topped it off by eating at the Italian's place Guy Fieri, who is aka Guido.   We started with the Sashimi Won-Taco shareables. Awesome. My daughter wanted more --- all of us did.Then, my wife ordered the carne tacos, I ordered a burger and my daughter ordered the pork sandwich. All were awesome.The mixture of the fries were great! Though, I'd like a twist on the sauce, say, a kicked up Dill dipping sauce for the fries along with the standard ketchup. (Fryer Tuck eatery in Portland, OR had that sauce years ago with their wedge-like fries)  Unfortunately, we had a problem. The dessert. My wife and I loved the Monte Cristo dessert creation but my daughter had an allergic reaction. We had asked the waitress if there were any tree nuts in the dessert. She checked. The Kitchen told her no. (I wonder if peanut oil uses any tree nuts.)  But reaction was just like a reaction she had before with tree nuts. Her lips became swollen, throat itchy and bumps on her head. (Several hours past till she was okay again.)  The waitress immediately got the assistant manager involved. She was a super waitress, and he was a super man as a manager.  He went way above and beyond the call of duty --- he went to store across the way and purchased Benadyrl for my daughter!   Wow, the assistant manager treated us as if we were Guy, his wife Lori and this had happened to one of Guy's sons Hunter or Ryder.  The manager comped us the $90 bill too!   We left a nice tip for our waitress despite the incident because service and food were excellent.  We will definitely go back for not only the great food but the awesome customer service.  By the way, Guy seems so real and unpretentious like we're part of his family --- and now we witnessed how that attitude spilled over into the attitude of his staff.  Finally, here's a big and heartfelt thank you to Guy, his family and his wonderful staff for taking care of our daughter though it was an unfortunate incident, it made it more palatable for us even if was for the rest of the evening.  We wish Guy, his family and his staff much success with the new "Guy Fieri's Vegas Kitchen and Bar"!  See you next time we're in Vegas! We will definitely be eating at "Flavortown" again!  By the way, Italians, Food, and Casinos go well together. Bada bing, Cha Ching!   Guido, you know what I'm sayin'?

      Im in love with this place!! I watch Guy on tv all the time and he finally opens a new restaurant! Whoo hoo! It was better than i anticipated. I dont really eat american food but this place hands down has the best burgers ive had so far. First time i had fried ice cream and it was amazing! They do have salads but if your looking for healthy, this is definitly the wrong place to eat at. But cheat day go all in! Everything you love about american food, its fried, its beefy, its sweet, and great portions!

      I'm a fan of Guy Fieri, he's from Vegas and I love his Diners, Drive-ins and Dives so I was excited to try his new restaurant.  The place had a cool casual decor, wood and metal.  Went on a nice Sunday for lunch.  We were seated after about a 20 minute wait.  We ordered our drinks and it came.  Flagging a server was like trying to flag a taxi -- can't find one.  I don't know where our server disappeared to.  After that it took about an hour to get our appetizer which came with our sandwiches and tacos.  Presentation was nice!  I ordered the big dip or whatever it was called -- I can't remember since it's best to forget how dry it was -- it needed au jus which I recommend on the side.  My son ordered the fish tacos.  He said it was plain and not much flavor.  My other son ordered the blackened chicken sandwich or whatever it was again.  It was easy to forget because he said it was just ok.  The truffle fries were great, skinny cut and flavorful.  The server forgot my daughter's water.  She finally got it when our food was brought out.  Service was 1 out of 10.  We ordered another appetizer which never came but were charged and also a beer that we didn't order.  When our server came to bring our check and I told him how bad the service was he started to argue with me and made excuses.  I don't want to hear they just opened 4 days ago.  Apologize, give me a free soda or something for me to return!  Which I won't.  Did he come  to see how we were doing during the hour wait?  Not!  The lunch experience left a bad taste.  We live in Vegas and expect much more from a Strip restaurant especially from Guy Fieri.

      Like every other restaurant / bar / club on the Strip, this place is stupidly overpriced, but what do you expect? I should have known our experience was going to be a bad one when the hostess told my friends and I there was going to be a 40 minute wait when I could clearly see empty tables throughout the place. As we're waiting, we notice groups of people coming in after us, yet they're getting seated no problem. One of my friends complains to the hostess and she says, "Oh sorry, I thought you left." Seriously? We eventually get seated and place our orders with an overly excited server. The restaurant, though busy, isn't packed but for some reason, it takes a while for the food to get there. I guess the food was so-so, seeing as how some of my friends finished their food while others did not. We ask for the check and remembering how other reviewers posted to show a Total Rewards card for a discount, I handed my card to the server. The adjusted bill was a whopping $1.42 cheaper than it would have been had I not given him my card. Long story short, I really don't see why people love this place. I might come back if my friends put a gun to my head, but I think I'd rather have them pull the trigger...

      My wife and I tried this yesterday. When we checked in we were told there would be a 40 minute wait, plus we also requested the outdoor patio. We'd get called around 25 minutes, but they forgot about the patio request and wanted to seat us inside. We eventually got the patio seating.    Once seated, service was on the slow side. We ordered drinks, I got the Sammy Hagar rum drink, which was very good. But our order was not taken until we got our drinks after a long wait.  We ordered hamburgers, I got the Mac and Bacon Burger. I took about 30 mins to come out. The burgers are smash burger style, and unfortunately ours were on the over done side. The burger is described as an award winning burger, but not in this case. The Mac and cheese was stingily applied and could not overcome the dryness of an overdone burger.   During the whole time there, when visits from the server were few and far between, there were about six people getting a table ready for a group of 15. Must have been a VIP, because it was setup meticulously. I've never seen that much cleaning and rechecking of the setup before. Maybe if they put that much attention to the rest of the customers, it would have been a better experience.   Since it's only been open a week, hopefully things will get better. But with so many choices for good food in Vegas, it's hard to give places a second chance.

      Great food and fun atmosphere. The fireball whiskey wings were really good. Great burgers, great desserts, wonderful menu. Can be a bit pricey for a casual restaurant but the location is wonderful. If you have a Total Rewards players card, you get $1 off your entree. I will go back to try other menu items!

      This place is amazing!!! The environment, the decor, the customer service, and the food are all on point! I got the chili and an order of fries, they were both delicious! We are outside, which was perfect and very comfortable. The prices are unbeatable for being a celebrity restaurant. I will absolutely be back next time I'm in town, and I've already told all my family and friends that they have to check this place out! Can't wait to come back, and the staff were all super friendly.

      Like the show "DDD", but had no idea if Fieri was a talented chef or not.  If his menu at this place is any indication, he won me over.  The chx wings were fun to look at and eat.  The flavor is spot on.  The pulled pork sandwich was great.....the pork was tender and the barbecue flavor fabulous; the best I've had in a long time and I'm no real fan of BBQ.  The kitchen was a bit slow and some of the pork portions were crunchy, but those are daily kitchen issues and nothing to do with the menu or the flavors.......I'd go again and try more of the menu, definitely.
