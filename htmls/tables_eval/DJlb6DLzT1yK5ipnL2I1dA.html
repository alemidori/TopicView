      The best nightclub I have been to in vegas (in awhile)!  The club is situated around a great waterfall and pool, and it's really cool.  The music was good, the people were cool, and it wasn't too crowded.  There's also an area where you can dance on a pole for all to see.  We were club hopping, so we didn't get to stay long, but it impressed me!

      Uh, I was incredibly underwhelmed by this place.  The only reason it didn't get one star is because the design of the club really is stunning.  It's situated right under the restaurant Okada, next to the famous waterfall in the Wynn and the lighting and design of the place is quite gorgeous.  Everything else, though, failed to impress.  The DJ was terrible, mixing miss-matched beats that no one could dance to.  There are much better ways to spend a $30 cover charge on a Friday night in Vegas.  I suppose I did get a pretty hearty laugh out of the fugly girls fighting over who could be the biggest whore at the pole--I think I saw one girl punch another girl trying to get her pole on.  Come to Vegas to SEE pole dancers, not to BE pole dancers, ladies.  Please.... I'm begging you.  For my sake and yours--leave the dirty work to the professionals.

      Asking around Vegas what the hottest club is at the moment, most people said, "Tryst!"  The place is packed to the walls until closing, which unlike SF is 4am-ish.  Decent mix of hip hop and dance hall while we were there.  People here were dressed to impress and you can't beat the outdoor patio area with the waterfall.  The inside is laid out in 3 lounge areas with a main dance floor that leaks out to the patio.  There are a lot of drunk, rude-ass people that constantly bump into you on the dance floor, but it could be like that at all clubs in Vegas.  It does pays to stay at the Wynn because we were taken past the line like freakin' VIPs just by flashing your room card.

      If you are trying to decide on a club to go to in vegas, this one is fun to check out. Mainly because of the waterfall. Kind of like the Niagra Falls of Vegas... but with drinks &amp; 80's music. Vegas is so artificial that I kept finding myself touching the plants and being in awe when they were real... Real Trees! Strange things start to impress you here.  It is also very easy to get free passes from the staff if you ask nicely(maybe not for a sat. night though). In addition, true story: I met A MAN here!! Okay, so maybe he was 75 (no, I am not exaggerating) but he was a personal friend of Mr. Steve Wynn and his pal had just won $10,000 and he had just aquired the keys to his penthouse suite in the Wynn. Classic Vegas story right?? If only Anna Nicole had been there...  The point of this story is, if you come here on a Sunday eve, you very well may be the hottest youngest things up in this joint. So do it!

      good place to mingle, hang out, dance and sip HUGE $20 drinks.  we liked how there were lots of places to sit and hang out outside by the big-a$$ waterfall (at least it wasn't like the one on the TV show Las Vegas... monstrosity!).

      Thankfully being on the guest list got us in without the $30 cover. It did not get us in fast. As another guest lister said "The idea here must be You're on our list, now  be our guest on this long line" A 30 minute wait is NOT VIP treatment.

      On the surface Tryst looks like the most luxurious, glamourous place you've ever been to. In reality the staff knows nothing about service and may as well be herding cattle. The place is always packed based on unjustified hype that is sure to fade as fast as a $100 bill on a roulette table if they don't start delighting their customers.

      We were in Vegas for a bachelor party two weeks back and needed a place for the main event of the weekend. After doing some digging around, the consensus seemed to be that Tryst is the newest and hottest of what Vegas has to offer. We've all heard the story of the 12 guys that walk up to the bouncer in a trendy club but never actually walk past the bouncer so we called ahead to make a table  reservation. Now I don't really know how this is calculated but the manager tells us that getting 12 guys to Tryst requires a 4 bottle minimum. Sure, what the heck it's a bachelor party! We make the reservation.
