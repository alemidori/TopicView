      Pulled pork sandwich was excellent.Baked beans had way too much black pepper,and the portion was extremely small for $2.00.Some of the prices are very high,28.00 for a full rack of baby backs?The guy that took my order said they would be using larger containers for the sides soon.As another poster said the staff is very friendly.I will definitely go back,its close to my work,and i would like to try some other menu items.

      I eat a lot of BBQ... I thought the portions were excellent along with prices... I really try to eat a variety of things before I make an informed decision.... I had every thing on the menu... The taste of all the smoked meat was nothing short of excellent... And sides are excellent too. Especially the beans and cole slaw.... It was lip smacking and finger licking good... Kudos for bringing some excellent BBQ to Vegas

      This is not Southern style brisket. It's chewy and fatty (i found three large chunks of fatty brisket that somebody could choke on if they tried to swallow it). Listen, I ate at 36 real southern BBQ joints last summer and this brisket would rank last. Website says he is from Arkansas, but I would like proof because the brisket doesn't qualify as southern. You can tell by the way he chops it, real BBQ brisket is more shredded. He also should know nobody serves brisket on a hoagie roll in the south, it comes on a bun. Rollin Smoke has two sauces, one claims to be hot, but both taste exactly the same, nothing stands out in that respect. Moving onto the side dish, which is in a tiny cup and not worth the $2. It was jalapeno coleslaw and wasn't too bad, but I honestly didn't see any jalapeno's in the cup. It also appears he has changed the prices - up of course - after being open a week. The online menu says a combo includes drink, chips and side for $2, now the chips are excluded. The price of 1/2 rack of ribs is $10 online and $12 on another menu that is off to the side inside the place, but on the official menu it is now $16. The big smoker on the outside and good smell makes this place appealing to the eyes and nose, but it doesn't pass the taste test. If you do go, show the website coupon on your phone to save 10 percent and that way when you get home and eat your nasty brisket at least you will have saved some money and won't feel as bad.

      Fabulous BBQ.  Before this joint, the best BBQ I have had was a tie between a place in Raleigh, NC and the shack on Corpus Christi Naval Air Station in TX.  Very authentic, not too smokey but just right.  The beans were nothing short of incredible.  Next time I will be trying the jalapeno cole slaw.  I certainly hope business is good for them because it is downright impossible to find reasonably priced, authentic bbq in Vegas.  Good advertising having the smokers in the parking lot or else I would never have known it was there.   Only suggestion I would make would be to add more sides such as collards, etc.

      This is a new out of the way bbq restaurant that recently opened on Highland Dr.  I know that Highland is an industrial and seedy area west of the strip, but these guys are turning out some good bbq and making the most of what they have.  I recently tried the Biggin sandwich (brisket, pulled pork and sausage) and it was very tasty.  The sandwich was loaded with meat, literally falling off the bun, all of the meats were tender and had a good smoke flavor.  Along with my sandwich was a side of bacon potatoe salad, which was good.  The potatoe salad had good flavor and bacon in just about every bite.  Total for my sandwich, salad and drink ran me $11, which I think is a good value for quality food. This is a spicier bbq than most people are used to, but it works.  It reminds me more of a kicked up Kansas City style bbq.  I stuck with the original sauce, which was plenty hot and did not try the spicy or the extra spicy.  All in all this place is making some pretty good bbq, which is much needed in Las Vegas.  The biggest draw back is that they are located on Highland next to Diamond Cabaret and they are only open until 6pm.  I would like to see this place do well, hence my review, but their limited hours and location create much doubt. Good Luck!

      This place is really good BBQ, I hate fat and gristle so I stay away from some of the meats; I got the hotlink sandwich, the baked beans, and loaded mashed potatoes. It was all very good. The location has something to be desired. During the day I felt fine; I have a feeling at night the safe factor goes way down. Two, what I assumed to be, strippers were here when we got lunch and one of them out right propositioned my boss. After a good laugh we all sat down and ate our meal. Everyone was full and pleased. It seems this place gets more business by the day. During the lunch hour they ran out of seats and the line can build up quickly.

      The BEST Bar B Que place in Las Vegas, Hands down!! The meat was so tender and juicy. Pretty much perfect! This is Vegas NOT down SOUTH but this will def compare to some southern Bar B Ques. No I havent ate at 38 bar B Que places (Seeing as its horrible for you and good way to get huge) but out of the few I have in Vegas I will never go back to any except for this one. The Pulled pork was the best I have had in Years. DEFFFFF need to try this place.

      I waited to write this review. I've been to this place five times now and I am not a fan. The first two times the baby back ribs were good but a bit over cooked but good. The third time I got beef ribs and they were terrible. It had a big piece of fat right in the middle of the rib and overcooked. The last two times I got the baby backs again and they were really overcooked. I know most restaurants talk about the meat falling off the bones and they did. But these were so overcooked the meat was too soft and mushy.

      Really good restaurant. Although the place was a bit empty for being 5 PM, the food was very fresh and well-prepared. I had the piggy wrap and it was very flavorful! I will definitely try one of their meat platters next time that I'm in.

      My quest for excellent non-chain restaurants continues, and finding this one was a happy accident.  There are large smokers in the parking lot which is originally what drew our attention to the place.  Usually we find our gems from Yelp, but this time it was a drive-by (or I should say that I find places on Yelp as the bf is in the food industry and like many industry people has a baseless grudge against Yelp).    Since i am not a huge meat eater what I really care about are the sides.  The sides were amazing.  Which is great because a lot of times at BBQ places the focus is on the meat only and the sides are kind of an after thought.  The peach cobbler was insanely good.  And I have been dreaming about the loaded mashed potatoes since I had them.  I also had the mac n cheese.  The waiter (who I assume is also one of the owners since he thanked us about 20 times for coming in) recommended the mac n cheese.  Listen if you can't execute a delicious mac n cheese you should throw yourself off a bridge.  It's macaroni, cheese, cream and bake.  It was really good but I was more impressed with the other sides that are nonstandard and were amazing.  On my next visit I plan on trying the banana pudding.      It does have its advantages and disadvantages, depending on who you are.  It is right down the street from the Rhino - a disadvantage to me, but an advantage to any dirt-bags.  The parking lot is kind of sketchy, again a disadvantage to me, but like home to dirt-bags.  The BBQ sauce is really peppery.  I personally like milder sauces and I am not a big meat eater, but I could still appreciate the execution of the sauce and that it was made in house.  I am not used to eating smoked meat so was a little concerned that the chicken looked pink, but the bf explained to me that that is how smoked meat should look that has actually been smoked in a smoker and not just marinated in smoke "flavor".  All the meat was very tender, but the sauce was a little too intense for me.  That being said I was more than happy to stick with the sides.

      You have got to be kidding me!!!   I didn't think I could find good bbq in this town, but this place is so, so awesome.  We had bbq like this in the midwest and who would have thought it would come to LV?  Forget the famous chefs.  The location is not exactly ritzy, but the food is great.  They could use a TV or 2 in there, but the brisket and pulled pig are fantastic and I love the jalapeno cole slaw.

      Serve me up some smoky, tender pork slathered with some of the best tasting barbeque sauce I have ever had (including the Scott's BBQ sauce I order from North Carolina!) at a ridculous low price.  Throw in a friendly little hostess/server and a greeting on my first visit from Chef Tim, the master smoker himself.  Then hide your restaurant next to Spearment Rhino and I just may be a customer for life!  I heard about Rollin Smoke through word of mouth and looked it up on Yelp only to see it had amazing reviews.  I have to join the bandwagon.  Chef Tim has something special here.  Amazing barbeque and great sides which are a must to be a good BBQ joint in my book.  Don't even get me started on the baked beans and jalapeno coleslaw!  For the quality of food, the prices are crazy low.  No liquor license yet, but for a small corkage fee you can BYOB.  If you force me to find a con, I would say the parking lot is not very big and the bathroom looks like a 1970's situation.  Fortunately, I don't judge a restaurant on those factors.  To me, it only adds to the experience that at any given moment, you can see a blue collar guy in uniform chowing down or a hungry Rhino worker.  BEST BBQ IN VEGAS!  Don't even doubt.

      OK it's a little off-beat for a location, off of Highland in an industrial mega-plex area, strip bars and mechanics shops vie for attention.  You can't miss the big smokers out front though, sitting in the parking lot like beasts of barbecue.   You go inside and like a magical mirror, the place is so much bigger in than out, with a side room and front room with tables and chairs to hang out in.  NOW, the amazing part, the part that astounds is the BBQ!  I don't believe I have ever had better BBQ sauce...EVER.  The brisket wasn't tender but delicious, the hot link was extraordinary and the beans had chunks of beef that were staggering.  Everyone in our group (there were 9 of us) shut right up and dug in (although keeping the 5th star away for now was the somewhat unorganized service).  If you love BBQ, there is NONE better in Vegas, or maybe even in the great state of Nevada.  Heck, I would put it up against the little smoke houses in my wife's hometown of Nashville!  Truly superb food and the banana pudding at the end was heaven itself.  If you are into "fancy" you don't know BBQ anyway so this aint for you.  IF YOU WANT the best tasting BBQ in town though, this is the place for you!   GET SOME!!!

      It's always a good sign when you show up at a BBQ place and several smokers are fired up in the parking lot. I found this place on Yelp and wanted to try a new BBQ place on my business trip to Vegas. This place did the trick and then some.  Excellent, friendly service. Pulled pork, brisket and mac and cheese were all very good. Very tender meat with a smoke flavor that was just right -- not overpowering at all. Sauce was slightly vinegary and was definitely peppery, as someone else mentioned, but I like that. Next time, I want to try the hot links and ribs.  And don't skip the banana pudding.  There's plenty of time for the chains. This is the kind of place that I hope both locals and tourists would support.

      Just finished a fan-freaking-tastic Christmas lunch from Rollin Smoke and wanted to recommend this place for catering!    Since nothing says Merry Christmas like great BBQ, I knew I wanted to treat our office to some Rollin Smoke for Christmas. Best. Idea. Ever.  Chef Tim hooked it up!  Lunch was for 14 people, but I swear we got food for twice that! A huge thing of Kickin Beans, Coleslaw, barbequed chicken, ribs, pulled pork, sandwich rolls, sauce and . . . wait for it . . . mac n cheese.  I hate mac n cheese.  I'm serious.  I hate it.  Just want you to understand who you are dealing with here.  So I never thought these words would come out of my mouth, but: I loved this mac n cheese!  Had a little kick to it (like most food here) and was really good.  I just hope my waistline can survive my obsession with this place!  haha.

      Trolling around for some BBQ in the Veg. We lost my favorite BBQ joint Pit Boss BBQ. They just up and left and didn't give their customers the heads up if they were going to set up shop somewhere else. A lot of their fans were disappointed when they disappeared.  The homie tells me of this new joint chillen on D.I. and Highland. I'll pho'ks with it. I roll up and see huge smokers out front. Very good sign. I go inside thinking it's going to be another hole in the wall. Inside looks nice and accommodating. Lot's of places to sit and get down.   So I try and sample as much as I can. I get the trio combo and a half rack of baby back ribs. Hey! Don't diet! Try It!    Trio Combo: The trio combo comes with brisket,  a hot link, pulled pork, some bread, a few pickle slices, a side (mashed potatoes), and a side of their BBQ sauce. Their hot link came in first, with their pulled pork and brisket comming in an honorable second. Their hot links stood out with the most flavor from this combo. Coming back for more of this tube steak. You can definitely taste the smokey flavor of their passion.   Baby back ribs: They difinitely have this one on lock down. Very smokey and tasty. How can you mess up baby back ribs? Fall off the bone with their tangy BBQ sauce makes this one a definite come back.   BBQ sauce: Their BBQ sauce has a tangy spicy taste to it which will linger with you after you finish feeding your face. They give you a lot of sauce with their BBQ and give you a side of more BBQ sauce just in case. There have been a couple of spots where they just give you a dab of BBQ sauce. Come on folks! Don't be stingy with your BBQ sauce.  This is a solid diamond in the rough. It's kind of tricky getting here. If you like BBQ, try this place out and support them. It's hard to find some solid BBQ in Vegas these days. They're doing a great job. I had the coworkers sample some of their BBQ when I got back from lunch. Definitely a new lunch spot for the gang. Still have to try their beef ribs and everything else that's on the menu.   Rollin Smoke Barbeque....EYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!

      Real Good authentic dry rub smoked BBQ. Total hole in the wall with some of the best pulled pork I've had... huge portions and freindly staff... If you like the corporate heat and serve food nicely packaged in a themed resteraunt, go there and not here. If you want real food and real people, this is the place.. I will always go here when I'm passing through...

      I wish there were an option for 3.5 stars, but since I am convinced they will impress me next time I will go ahead with the 4. First off this place ain't for vegetarians, there's a huge stuffed hog's head next to the tables.  As well as a big Razorbacks poster. I had to ask if they were from Arkansas considering I took a road trip there over the summer and had my fair share of southern BBQ. Sure enough they answered with "wooo pig suuuiii" which if you know anything about college football or the razorbacks, you'll understand.  Between 3 of us we ordered 3 sandwiches (hot links &amp; pulled pork) and a half rack of baby back ribs. I really enjoyed the ribs, not too much fat, perfectly blackened and the sauce was homemade and peppered well. I also ordered a mac &amp; cheese side. Still wondering how that was because they served me loaded mashed potatoes instead. We also ordered it Togo, and they brought it all out on trays, to dine in. We did not complain about the side mix up, nor the unboxed food. We simply stayed and enjoyed our grub. The taters looked great and were; other than some of the bacon bits inside were a tad undercooked. The sweet tea was also a plus.  I only seen one employee and noticed he was running outside to the smoker pit, taking orders, handing out orders, as well as doing the cleaning. They were pretty busy and could have used another person.  The reason ultimately they got 4 stars, the food was great, and the guy serving us was pretty awesome regardless of the mistakes made. Double checked on us, made sure we got the free dessert with our yelp check in, genuinely cared about making the place work. Hopefully being right next to the strip clubs, they will last. I will for sure return to try the brisket and catfish.

      OMG...the BBQ sauce is sweet and spicy at the same time but definitely ask for extra. The cup they give you just isn't enough. The banana pudding is homemade and to die for. Go hungry and expect to leave satisfied.

      The beef brisket was delicious &amp; very filling - I couldn't even finish it!  The beef ribs were HUGE and fell off the bone. Try the Mac &amp; cheese if you like pepper - but it's good.  The owners are 2 brothers from Arkansas who really take pride in their southern BBQ food. It's not far off the strip and they have 3 big smokers right in front.  You have to keep your eye out for it or you might drive by - like we did!    Definitely give them a try - it will be worth it.

      HANG UP THE PHONE! I found this total hole in the wall on Yelp, and BOY Im glad I did!  Hubbys from Texas and cant find decent brisket here despite many a valiant effort.   Until now. Heres the scoop:  This place is tucked behind a strip joint in the seedy area behind the mirage on highland drive.    In fact, if you're squeamish about going to the hood, you may want to come at lunch time rather than dinner.   If youre from out of town, dont expect much in the way of atmosphere. The decor is minimal. There are six tables total in the small front room, and maybe 6 or 8 inthe small side room.  .   This place belongs on diners drive ins and dives for sure.    Service was ok. At times we had to wait a few minutes for servers to emerge from the kitchen. However, When they werent cooking, they were polite &amp; personable.  Despite all of this, the rating is five stars for the food alone.   This food really is off the hook.   1. Biggest beef ribs ive ever seen and thats not an exaggeration. 8oz of beef on each one at least. Sooo tender .&amp; juicy, and the sauce was perfect  2. Best brisket in town, hands down. TENDER, MOIST, unlike at every other wannabe bbq place in town.   3. The fried okra was the best ive had this side of the mississippi, OR north of the mason-dixon line. I dont like okra if its not perfectly cooked. This was. I was frankly shocked!   4. Jalapeno coleslaw was very good if a bit hot!  5. Blackberry cobbler was pretty good. I enjoyed it.   Portions are good sized &amp; filling.  Note: Theres a soda machine tucked in an alcove thats hard to find. At first we thought all they had to drink was sweet tea with no ice lol  In short: if youre from the south and are craving authentic bbq, this place is worth the trip. Oh, and the prices are HALF that of lucilles bbq. Five stars!

      Hit Rollin Smoke today for lunch.    Location ain't the most convenient for me but i was at nearby Caesar's earlier throwing the dice, i came out on top so time for a treat.  As usual, I previously saw Nelson's review of the place and though i've never met the guy, i like how he food rolls so let's try da smoke !   A little concerned when i walk into the place - a lady in front of me was there to pick up a large phone order for the office she works in - apparently, the order was misplaced.  Props to the staff, they stepped up and got the order confirmed and my guess is it took them less than 10 minutes to get the order ready and they comped the sides !  good job !  The older guy that took my order is a good 'ol boy - not sure what part of the south he's from but given the Arkansas razorback banner, i'm guessing Arkansas.  Had to repeat my order several times and he had difficulty putting the order into the POS system ( and sadly, he still got the order wrong )  Ordered:  3 meat combo - pulled pork, links and brisket with a side of bacon potato salad ( also comes with a drink ) $13   couple of Bones ( ribs ) - $ 2 each   Side of mac and cheese and beans ( $2 each )   Outlaw Burger ( $7.99 ) - basically the kitchen sink burger   two other groups came in after me - both groups got their food before me - a little irritated about this but the guys were apologetic and explained that the burger takes 15 minutes to cook since it's a one pounder, and since i like the overall vibe of this place, i can let it slide.    Got the food, started driving home - yes, i ate everything but the burger while driving home - my shirt is soaking in the washer as we speak !  Caution - ASK FOR THE SAUCE ON THE SIDE ! Don't get me wrong, i loved the sauce but some may find the sauce to spicy or not spicy enough.  Plus, i like to taste the 'Q in it's "barren" state so i can admire the smoke ring, focus on the meaty, smoky flavor and then dip it into the sauce - just a personal preference.  Highlights -   DA MEAT ! - loved it all !  I really liked that the pork had decent chunks of bark.  The ribs were great - surprised at size and yet tender.  The brisket had the perfect smoke ring and great flavor.  Minor "beef" ( get it ? )  - they sprinkled some chopped green onions on the ribs - NO !   Mac N Cheese - nice creamy cheese with a little spicy bite to it - wish it was baked with a crunchy top but it still tasted great  Low points - again, a little on the slow side but just a slight knock.    The beans - several chunks of cartilage and grizzle but good flavor.  THEY FORGOT MY BACON POTATO SALAD.  WAHHHHHHHH ( major tears )   Pic of Burger included - i've yet to try it !    I will return and hopefully i can give them a 5 star review

      I love this place.  Its the best hole in the wall find that I have come across in a long time.  Its hard to get to and you literally have to know about it to eat there.  Thats the cool part.  I have had the pork ribs and then went back a week later for the beef ribs.  Both were awesome.  I am going to keeping taking my friends here.  These are the best ribs that I have had in town.  They also have a ground beef/brisket hamburger that I am dying to try.  This place has no thrills but incredible food.  Highly recommended for the food and adventure.
