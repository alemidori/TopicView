      Amazing place for nightlife so far. The boulevard pool is lavish and sure to be the it spot for summers to come. The casino area is over cramped with multiple games which gives off the feeling of a downtown casino. Restaurants are posh, but I think the cosmo sets itself apart with the lounge like bars. A good use of space and distances itself from other casino lounges. Music is resonating throughout the casino but quiets down upstairs for people watching and restaurant areas.

      We attended the grand opening of the 3.9 billion dollar new resort tonight and the place was packed.   We had cocktails at the Chandelier Bar which is three stories high and includes a glass stairway with glass treads and images that are projected behind the chandelier beads. Very chic, modern and unique.   The hotel lobby columns are lined with video screens which have images that are changing constantly. In the gaming areas they have single deck black!  I'm looking forward to staying here in the future and experiencing the new restaurants and entertainment In Las Vegas.

      It definitely has a great vibe to it, especially on opening night with all of the tourists and locals alike out to check out the newest and hippest new casino to open on the Strip.  Walking in from the 2nd level walkway connecting to Crystals, we immediately encounter a bikini shop called Molly Brown's.  And all I can say is WOW!  The live models posing in the skimpy bikinis was enough to gather a huge crowd.  I lost my friends from school almost immediately. Yeah, that crowded :p  Anyway, there is a lot of retail stores in Cosmopolitan.  The place is not big, but I think the square footage allocated to retail is significantly higher than most Las Vegas casinos.  The line up of restaurants are also very impressive, and the prices for dinner in most of them are pretty reasonable by mega resort standards.  Think $20ish for dinner entree, in the teens for appetizers.  The hostesses standing at the entrences of the restaurants are also especially friendly, (Comme Ca) one even approached us and escorted us inside to the balcony area overlooking LV Blvd and the big Bellagio sign.  In spite of the rumor that they mostly stocked the hotel staff with "models", I was a little disappointed that I didn't see all that many super attractive women working there.  There were quit a few men that look nice in the tailored suits, but unfortunately I am not into that.  The layout of the casino area also makes Cosmopolitan look especially busy.  Unlike Aria, which is spreadout over a much larger square footage space, the more consolidated arrangement really works for Cosmopolitan.  The art works in Cosmopolitan are also more approachable, in my opinion.  Guests were posing inside giant high heel shoes, which is something that would probably be shunned at in other casinos or museums. The columns of changing displays in the lobby near where I think the guest check-in is, is art, but most people will probably not think it is. Yep, Cosmopolitan has made it easier for the avergae joe to apprece and enjoy art.  Oh yeah, they also have 5 Art-o-Mats, which sells $5 mini works of art.  At first I thought it was a cigarette or cigar machine with fancy wrappers, but they are machines repurposed to sell and promote art.  Pretty cool.  Finding parking in a popular casino garage can often be a pain in the tushy, but a cool feature in the Cosmopolitan garage that will save a lot of time are the green and red lights over each parking slot, which will tell you if the space is occupied or not.  And they of course have the usual signs that tells you howmany spots are available at each parking level.   Overall, I like it thus far.  And rating based on look and layout, I have to say it is a solid 4 stars.

      This place was amazing. When you walk in, it takes a little while to figure out the vibe of the place, but as you walk around, you sense that it's fresh, young, and stylish. They have art everywhere, and places like the lobby and lounges have different schemes and touches that set them apart from one another. Enough, so that they stick in your mind after you leave the establishment. It was opening night, so I'm assuming that's why everyone was so cheerful and friendly, but I hope it's a quality they keep.   The only complaints I have are the elevators in the lobby that takes you between the three floors. They are not only slow, but they are extremely small! No more than 10 or 11 people can fit, and if you have a friend who is wheelchair bound like we did, that number is even less.   Also, the music was a little weird, considering the vibe you get when you go to the hotel. It wasn't exceptionally current, or edgy... However, like I said, it could just be because it was opening and the middle of the week.  Overall, it is easily my favorite hotel on the strip and I can definitely see myself celebrating there in the very near future!

      There was little evidence of the LV slump here on opening night, with tastings abuzz with industry suits around the restaurants and a packed casino floor once the property opened to the general public. And with good reason: the Cosmopolitan is a beautiful, modern hotel, second only to Wynn/Encore as the nicest on the Strip.  The biggest feather is Cosmo's hat is Marquee Las Vegas, the most impressive nightclub I've seen and one that will give XS a run for its money. With 3 levels ranging from a house mega-floor to a attic library, the venue has only small echoes of the boutique feel of its sister property at 11th Ave &amp; W. 27th St. If the 2nd and 3rd tier clubs around City Center are smart, they'll set their sights on the spillover crowd from Marquee. Besides building a beautiful indoor/outdoor day/night haven, the Tao team have done a nice job of dovetailing with the casual living room-esque whimsy that Cosmo as a whole -- with pool tables scattered around, for instance -- is aiming for.  If you come, ask for a room overlooking the Bellagio fountains.   Cosmo will be getting the wrinkles out over the next few weeks: - Customer service lines that ring off the hook and reps who have no clue what they're doing - Bathtub knobs that fall off - TV remotes that don't work - Dealers who have trouble cutting decks - Showers that won't get hot - A loyalty website that's broken - Bartenders who push alcohol of people they know don't drink (unconscionable) - Dealers who push gaming on people they know don't gamble (unconscionable) - Front desk printers that don't, well, print  ...but those fine points to be expected of a fresh-out-of-the-shrink-wrap property. All in all, Deutsche Bank's accidental foray into gaming is off to an auspicious start. Now let's see whether they can resist the temptation to go to channel partners for more than....a month? :)

      Its all in the name-- The Cosmopolitan.  Formerly a hotel-condo, the property was properly designed for various levels of entertainment.  However, what about a casino?  The casino floor is very tiny compared to many big, corporate resorts on the strip.  It does have a high limit area incorporated on the casino floor-- a handful of tables and slot machines.  The area does get lost among the rest of the casino, for obvious reasons being the size, and does not exactly seem too fancy.  The most horrible part, they took so much money opening night.  Incentives to come back?  Though the resort does entice you to look closer at the enormous Swarovski crystal chandelier, why get any closer to the tables if you exhausted your marker to the last penny.  Wrong move, Cosmo. Wrong move.    As for the room.  I stayed on the 62nd floor in a 1200 square foot suite, with a wrap around porch.  From the full size Miele equipped kitchen, to the million thread count beddings, the suite was surely one to impress. The wrap around porch does raise some concerns for the rowdy, avid, gambler/drinker.  One stupid move, and your stay at the Cosmopolitan could cost you more than that crystal chandelier.    In a nutshell, the Cosmopolitan does its definition justice-- very sophisticated.  Great food.  Great staff.  Great property.  But like all resorts, there are some things to work on.

      Finally, a hotel befitting of its name. Tres bon, tres chic. Compared to Aria, I was very impressed since Cosmopolitan puts Aria to shame for being a boring casino/hotel or even realizing how stupid Aria's name is. However, the people who designed the cosmopolitan should be applauded for the design and overall casino/hotel configuration.  The decor is amazing! There are retail shops towards the front facade of the cosmopolitan. In the casino area, there are several bars which most people were gathering. The way they setup this casino is conducive for people gathering and watching. I though the players rewards card for this hotel is very creative. It is called "identity."  Also, the waitresses at this hotel are actually sophisticated. They are not in skimpy trashy outfits like the other hotels. It definitely adds class to this joint. There is an abundance of art work towards the back of the casino area which I have to say is also very tastefully chosen. I hope it does well because it certainly would be a hotel/casino that I'd come back to visit.

      I haven't stayed at the Cosmo, I've only walked through it, so take this review with a grain of salt. Here are a few things that make this place cool.  - There's interesting art everywhere. From the street art in the parking garage to the digital art in the lobby and throughout the hotel there's a different vibe here than other casinos on the strip. It feels fresh, it's engaging, and gives the place a unique personality.  - The Art-O-Mat machines. They're refurbished cigarette machines that sell original art from artists around the world for $5. I'm not sure how many people will actually use these machines, but it's a cool gimmick to showcase rising or established artists that many people might not know.  - The Identity loyalty program. It keeps track of all the money you spend here. Not just on gambling, but also on things like food. I eat out a lot and rarely gamble. So this is a program that'll benefit me.  - I'm a big fan of Jose Andres and he's got two restaurants here.  - The Chandelier Bar. It just looks really impressive and will be a great place to hang out.  - It's a Marriott partner and part of it's Autograph Collection of independent hotels. If/when I stay here I'll rack up some Marriott points (Marriott is usually my hotel of choice when traveling).

      Pink chandeliers, crystal embedded pillars, gold speckled sparkling floors,  and rope/crystal entwined gaming....some of what makes up The Cosmopolitan.  I'm sure at some point the reference will be "Cosmo."  We happen to arrive in Vegas on grand opening day of the hotel/casino.  I have to mention, the engineer of the parking garage should be given an award for those parking "red" and "green" lights to know where the available spots are located.  I know there are several of those here in Los Angeles, but it seems like Vegas is behind on this technology.  As soon as you walk in from valet, there are retro pink chandeliers with crystals  and continuing into the casino has somewhat a clubby vibe.  I'm not sure if the vibe was only because of the grand opening with several areas set up with DJs at the bars, lounge and in the middle of the casino.  I'm going to take a guess and say yes.  I don't see how this place could be like this all the time.  Let's face it everything is sparkly, new and fresh.  There are interactive screens to learn about the hotel/casino and digital screen pillars that change light bulb images on them in the check-in area.  They are definitely going for that tekkie and posh design.  It's a casino that they can drop onto Sunset Blvd. and it would fit in quite nicely.  As we stood in line for our Identity cards aka players card, we were told that this place originally was only going to be condos (can you imagine how large the rooms must be?), but the property was going into foreclosure, so someone stepped in and included the casino.  I have to say the casino seemed a bit small to me.  Maybe because it wasn't intended to be a casino? I do like the openness of the bar (the one closest to the strip entrance) and crystals sparkling all around (yes, i love sparkly things). Oh and your Identity cards rack up points when you eat, shop and play and Cosmo - so use it to start earning free play and possibly discounted rooms.  We played for an 1 1/2 here on the Cash Spin machines.  Almost won $5,000 (had that needle stayed on the $5k!)...that would have been nice to be a big winner on the first opening day.  Let's see how this place does once the buzz slowly fades.  Personally, it's a small casino (unless I missed the rest of the casino - doubt it.), not as many machines or tables as the rest of the casinos on the strip.  I'd love to come here to be amongst the fixtures and relax at the bar if I can't get on any of the machines.

      We did not stay at The Cosmopolitan but only visited for a while.  We went on opening day and the place was packed!  We thought the Lobby and Casino were tacky compared to Vdara and Aria.  What were the designers thinking?  This hotel is "over the top" and not in a good way.  Good luck!

      Everything is hip and trendy. Young vibrant guest as we were walking through on the second day that they opened.   The parking entrance to property is kind of awkward and cramped.  BUT the parking garage is cool, they have electronics counters which tells you at every turns of how many available parking spaces, even the handicap space availability is listed. You can look to the ceiling and see if there is a green light above a space on any isles, it is available. :))   The interior is modern, European look and feel. Although it seems a little cramp and busy looking, we were very impress with, the sparkling chandelier that mimic curtains, as well as partitions, and also as an actual decorating chandelier encompassing the escalators that leads to different area of the casino, bars and restaurants area.   Went to the buffet, way over staff and not enough people eating. But that is usually how it is in the beginning for most of these hotels. But also, being that it is a slow time for Vegas also. That was not a problem for us.  THE FOOD- nothing was labeled yet, so we had to ask the chef for everything that we could not recognized. They have really good specialty salads, made with goat cheese or fresh mozzarella's. um mm.  Also have a selections of sushi rolls, couple of noodles style. Various fish and or seafood dishes. But mainly it seems to be lots of chicken and lamb cooked in different ways. They also have middle eastern selections also with hummus and gyros also. And then the typical buffet stuff, cows, clams, and shrimps. And dessert off course.   As we were leaving we were attracted to the sound of the music that was being played, we checked it out. It was right around the escalator area that was an open lounge. Booths full of people and 2 female dj, dress in winter white, spinning the tunes. Mostly dance/ techno music. Made me wanted to grab a booth and hanged out longer. Too bad had little ones waiting at home so we headed on out.

      FANTASTIC! Cosmo is a visually stunning place! It is my favorite modern casino (one built since the Eighties). The employees (including the employees of the independently run restaurants) are VERY friendly! The SECRET Pizza restaurant is great! Different , fun specialty cocktails at every bar. The GoGo pods in the Bar near the Jockey club entrance are cool! I like the idea of indie bands playing for free in the lounges-too bad they usually start at 10pm-not good for me most nights. Note-if you live on the West side, enter over the Harmon bridge-you miss all the strip traffic. It makes access almost as convenient as a Locals casino!  I would give this place 4.5 stars if I could. Some minor wrinkles.

      The parking is so dope here just look for a green light above. Once you occupy a parking spot the light turns red. If your in B2 parking area heading to the elevator just remember the Obey mural not only that but the elevator are nice with the digital fish tank inside. I've passed by the hotel registration area and you'll see the lighting is really dim but you'll see digital light bulbs flashing. A nice chill spots bar along the way to catch any football games on sundays. 4 levels of viewing around this casino each floor is artistic and ofcourse your expensive shops only good to look at.  The Marquee is located on the 17th floor.

      My wife and I had reservations for opening night.  Everything was top notch.  We were greeted at the valet a couple hours before actual check-in time, and they took our luggage to the bell desk.  We were greeted at the door by one of the staff and escorted to the lobby.  When we learned that check-in was going to be an hour or two still, we were giving a personal tour of the casino by another staffmember.  Very personable.       One thing that stands out is how friendly EVERY person was.  Not only friendly, but each person would look you in the eye as they spoke to you.        Our room was going to take longer than expected to be ready ( they were having touble with the computer system, which is why I did'nt  give a 5 star rating), so we were hungry and the only place serving food was The Henry cafe.  We each had very tasty sandwichs and cosmopolitans (you stay at the Cosmopolitan, you have a cosmopolitan, right?) and when we were ready to pay, we were told it was on the house.  Nice.        We got to the room, and it was very nice.  Since it was going to be condos originally, the room had microwave, sink, fridge, even a dishwasher.  The rooms at the Palazzo and Wynn are a little larger, but these are very comfortable, with a seperate living room area, bedroom and bathroom.  And as for the bathroom, twin sinks, decent counter space, and HUGE shower/tub.  While in either the tub( which was a deep square design) or the shower, you have a great view outside.       Each room also has a terrace which was great to sit outside and look at the traffic down below.  Very relaxing.       We went to the opening night tasting on the 2nd &amp; 3rd floor, which was cool.  Then went and played.  We each won a couple hundred on video poker then lost it at blackjack.  Not sure if it was just for opening night, but were lucky to find a $25 table.  We are used to $10 tables, so not sure if we will play much bj here in the future.      All in all, very nice evening.        PS  We also were at the opening at Aria last year, and this was SOOOO much better.  Aria was a cattle stampede at opening time, and the room was dirty from construction, TV didn't work, lighting system was screwed up, tiny room.

      I was fortunate enough to be at the Cosmo on opening night while on vacation. I was unfortunate to have lost my wallet on that night. Although it was an unbelievably packed night, security guard Robert Garcia did his best to help me find it. I will definitely come back and will urge my boyfriend to stay here next time

      This is totally the hot place - glitzy and modern. People call it 7 stars. It's a pretty place and you feel really relevant when you're there. It will be even better if/when the hype dies down.

      i can't really say much about The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, as our friends and I only went through it.  first impressions are everything.  my first impression was good.  but you know something yelp?  i didn't get wowed as i expected to get wowed.  the decor seemed the same as all the other new hotels that spring up in vegas these days.  i expected more uniqueness, but instead, i got more of the same.    don't get me wrong, i loved the atmosphere, i perhaps need to visit this place again in order for The Cosmopolitan for me to change my mind.  additionally, there was a robbery going on the night we came where the thief ran away with some chips and security flew pass by me as the thief dropped his chips.  of course, i returned the chips.  Specialty: Modernism  Recommendations for first timers: Look up  Service: ?/10 Variety: ?/10, Parking: ?/10   marc out.

      TELL ME ABOUT IT!? or shall I tell you...  This luxury Resort Casino and Hotel, located just south of Bellagio has plenty of jaw-dropping, eye-catching, word-by-mouth reactions to all locals &amp; tourists of the world...  One thing, that was to my amazement was the parking garage, where each parking was designed to have light fixtures above each parking spot that allows you to see if a parking is available (green: open / red: taken) ahhh...What a clever idea!!!!!  I like to think of this place as a museum and just enjoy the interior designed work and the overall architecture construction of the casino.  There is a handful of artwork and sculptures in the lobbies and not to mention the plenty of lounge seatings around the area.  Great backgrounds for pictures and it's the perfect place to head out to after filling your stomach with food.  I do have to try out the new night club "Marquee" on the 17th floor.

      The Cosmopolitan takes a large, diamond encrusted dump on every freakin' hotel on the Strip. I'm sorry Aria and Encore. You're still my loves but I think I'm about to end our relationship for someone wayyy hotter and sexier.  I can't believe I'm making this sound like a break up right now.

      This place is so amazing!! Definately will come back here! We spent the night here at a the Terrace one bedroom plus. I can't even describe how amazing it was. Very spacious with the japanese bathtub, view of the strip (that you could see while your in the bathtub as well) , huge balcony, nice design, and great service! The self parking here was so easy! before you enter the garage it would tell you how many are vacant, total of how many cars in each level, and the most AMAZING PART on top of each parking space there would be a red light on the roof right above it. If it is red its occupied, if its green its an open parking space. Makes my life so easy wow! No more driving all over the place to find a good parking. My only issue with the place I stayed that was that it was so hot, good thing its winter but the spacious room, comfortable beds, and everything that comes with it makes up for it.

      This place left me feeling confused. It's so beautiful and shiny, but so beautiful and shiny that it made me feel dirty and cheap. It's rather the opposite feeling when I walk into an old-style Vegas casino- one that's smokey and run down so that I feel like I look amazing.   In any case, this is a great escape for anyone looking to fill up on eye candy. There are so many wonderful, stunning features, to feast your eyes on, from the columns at the front desk, to the many chandeliers adorning the ceiling, to the tiny details making the elevator entrance look nicer than people's homes.   It didn't strike me as great for gambling, unless you're a high roller and throw money at dealers and machines, which I am not. BUT, it's totally a place to shop, dine, and party. The entrance to the club there, Marquee, leads you to elevators that take you up to the fourth floor, where I'm sure the opulence continues.   Big plus for the Identity club, which gives points for any activity in the resort, not just gaming.

      This is a review of the casino and public spaces. I have not yet stayed at this property.   Casino: The casino is beautiful. I think its kind of like a blend between Encore and Aria. It is well lit with red chandeliers like the former, with a modern and striking design language like the latter. There are also private gaming cabanas that you don't need to be a high roller to enjoy. All the dealers I encountered were also very fun to talk to and made losing money fun. Cocktail service was stellar. Quick, attentive, and very courteous.   Bars: There are many wonderful bar options lining the casino, and each has their own individual signature drink. My particular favorites are the Chandelier Bar (the main attraction at this hotel), and Bond (lots of LEDs and color changing screens with a strip view.) Tons of seating, and they wont even pester you if you just want to sit and chill and not buy a drink. Everyone should try the hotel's signature drink: The White Cosmopolitan. Very tasty.   Common Areas: Scattered throughout the property are various sitting areas with pool tables and other recreational games. They provide a very nice place to just sit, and relax or people watch. Best of all, they are free to use. Great Idea!   Identity Players Club: The players club rewards you for EVERYTHING you do at the hotel. Staying 8 nights gets you 1 night free. Dining and shopping earn you points, in addition to gaming. Another great idea.

      Wow, wow, wow.   The Glitz ! The Glamor ! I got invited to go with one of my friends to go to one of their play dates because she is a Spa Host here. Let me tell you, free food, free drinks, and a preview of their Marquee club. It was nice seeing it before the public opening, because I hear it's busy now.  Walking around the casino, it felt classy, the decor was beautiful. When I saw the glamorous chandelier, my mouth was open. The people at the Marquee club are funny, and the girls are pretty. Their music selection was quite nice. I must say I was having a mighty fine time because the bartender gave me an especially strong drink, well for me anyway.   I love how open this place is, and the decor. Now I must try the other restaurants in this place :-] I hear Wicked Spoon Buffet is off the hook.

      With pretty much every new hotel in LV essentially being a Bellagio/Venetian ripoff or a Palms/Hard Rock ripoff for the last 10 years, this place is a breath of fresh air.   Clocks. In a casino. I thought I would never see the day. It's high-end, without being snobby, pretentious or intimidating. Upscale, but generally inclusive. THIS is the type of place The Strip needs, a place that feels like it's for everyone.   The exterior gives you a very good, but not entirely obvious hint of what you would be getting yourself into once inside. The interior is a sight to behold. Strangely enough, this place reminded me of the Stardust (R.I.P.) to a certain extent. It has the flash and glitz of old Vegas, and yet doesn't forfeit subtlety in the process.   I really enjoyed browsing the small shopping arcade on the second floor. Thank god they didn't just follow the almost hilariously recycled Gucci and Louis Vuitton format every other new place has used. My favorite store was Crossover, it's not a very expensive store either.   I also loved all the artwork and statues all throughout the casino.   I hope this place serves as a sign to all of these entrepreneurs and corporate executives desperately trying to copycat the elegance and sophistication of another place. How about trying something new?   It will be interesting to see The Strip 20-30 years from now. I'm going to assume that this place retains it's relevancy and becomes a classic whereas the soulless cesspools known as the Wynn and Aria are considered "old and outdated" and put up for implosion. I would love to see that.

      Went to the Cosmopolitan over the weekend and was very impressed.  Being the newest casino on the strip amazing and beautiful is expected.  What impressed me the most was how friendly everyone was.  The cocktail waitresses were always around to check on you and even chit chat.  The dealers introduce themselves when you sit down and even ask your name.  The steak and eggs at Henry's was only ok for the price.    Overall a great place to play.  I hope everyone stays as friendly.

      If the Wynn had a menage a trois with the Hard Rock and Planet Hollywood...Cosmopolitan would be the love child.    They've crammed so much stuff into the place and all of it totally works.  Can't wait until the weather gets warmer to take advantage of the balconies and pool area.   Stores are really cool and I look forward to eating at the rest of the places here.  We went for xmas eve and did Comme Ca and Bond for drinks after.  Really fun night and we'll have many more I'm sure.  The future of Vegas is all right here!!  And who reviews the self parking garage??  The little light on top of each space letting you know if it's occupied (red light) or open (green) is the best thing ever!  I was driving around Caesars Palace wondering why all casinos don't add it.

      LOVED it!  Well, at least my eyes did..  The drinks were reasonably priced and, unlike the Mandarin Oriental, they had their own parking garage!

      An amazing hotel with incredibly friendly staff. This is the new hot spot on the strip---just opened last week and once again rises the bar for Vegas luxury and excess.  At the center of the hotel is the Chandelier bar---it takes up a good 3 floors and has probably a dozen or so bars---you literally have drinks inside a massive Chandelier. Food selection is great too...be sure to check out Blue Ribbon Sushi;)  The rooms are massive---try to get upgraded to a corner terrace room if possible. I had a ginormous balcony overlooking the entire strip---most Vegas hotel rooms don't even have operable windows (suicide rate is high in sin city), yet here I was with terrace on the 58th floor of the East Tower overlooking the strip. My terrace had 3 couches---that should give you a sense of it's size!  You know life is good when you look down on Planet Hollywood and Paris. The room was very well kitted out, tons of interesting art work and art books. I even had a full bar with 4 designer Martini glasses. I think the Cosmopolitan originally was going the condo route--my suite had a full-kitchen (the mini bar is in a normal sized fridge) and an in-suite laundry room complete with a washer and dryer. Super comfortable bed and a bathroom that is larger than most standard hotel rooms.  The service was fantastic. I will definitely be back!
