      This is an ultra-swanky - if not necessarily "classy" - upscale restaurant at the heart of the Strip.  I mean, how can a restaurant located on the landing of a fake Eiffel Tower in an amusement park hotel on the Strip in Las Vegas truly ever be considered classy? It couldn't. Anyhow, my dad, stepsister, her friend and I came here for dad's birthday a few weeks ago because he had always wanted to try it. You ride up an elevator to the restaurant and anti-climactically emerge into what amounts to the kitchen.  The layout of the restaurant is in tiers with booths facing out to the windows and a spectacular panoramic view of the Bellagio and its fountains.  The service is quite attentive, however the head waiter was just a tad bit creepy in his mannerisms and tone.  Now, the food is where this restaurant loses two stars because, although obviously quality ingredients, it just wasn't what you'd expect when you're laying out this kind of cash.  Appetizers were fair: Cynthia is right, the carpaccio is excellent, however, being a fan of fast food, it struck me as glorified Arby's meat.  I dunno. The scallop appie only came with two (for 20 bucks). The surf n' turf consisted of a very good fillet, but topped only with a small amount of baked crab meat, not the lobster tail that one would typically expect.  The sauces were just fair.  My stepsister's friend had the whole lobster, the presentation of which was odd: it was upside down and laid open on the plate, with spinach leaves and mushrooms tucked under the meat. Weird. Everything is a la carte, so you lay out more shells for the side dishes.  The potatoes au gratin were quite good, but the sauteed mushrooms a bit flavorless and gummy.  So all in all, have dinner here if its a super special occasion and someone else (such as dad) is footing the bill.

      I went to the Eiffel Tower twice in 2 years.  They have a very good seafood platter and their rack of lamb is excellent.  I plan to dine here each trip I take to Vegas.  Oh yeah....awesome views as well...

      1st Visit: I got invited to the Eiffel Tower Resturant at  the 11th floor of the Paris Hotel for a business function dinner.  The guests are whisked to the restaurant in a glass elevator that takes you to the electric activity of one of the city's top kitchens before being escorted to the dining room, where panoramic views and exquisite cuisine take center stage.  The glittering lights of the Las Vegas Strip appear even more dramatic in the dining room's intimate lighting, and guests are treated to spectacular views of the glorious Bellagio water fountain show across.  Metal framework from the Eiffel Tower dramatically breaks through the restaurant walls and creates a modernized art deco style. The course of the meal is defintely gonna satisfy you with the very, nice desert list.  Highly recommend an experience you'll remember! 2nd Visit: Order their Souffls!!! Regardless if the host tells you they take half hour to prepare for those Chocolate, Grand Marnier, Pistachio, Banana, Raspberry or Benedictine Souffls, order it! You'd love it!!! ^^

      I've been to 3 star Michelins and I was very impressed with the Tower.  Like Rick said, it is basically a restaurant in a theme park; but, the food, ambience and service negate all of that. The blue cheese souffle was not as strong as I hoped it would be; but, still good.  I had the lobster thermidor and it seemed that by ordering that I made the waiter very happy.  We were pressed for time to get to a show so we had to skip desert; but, I imagine it would have been delish. When I tried going here about 3 years ago I was wearing all black tennis shoes (Louis Vuitton mind you) and I was told that "gentlemen are not allowed inside the restaurnt while wearing sneakers."

      Insane. Was celebrating our engagement with my Fiance. Chef made us a special Chef Choice dinner including five appetizers, three entrees and a special desert decorated with our names in chocolate ganache.  Food was superlative from beginning to end. View of the Bellagio water show from our window table was spectacular. A lovely place to celebrate a special event.

      The restaurant raises its sun blockers around 6PM/7PM to reveal a summer sun set against Nevada's Rocky Mountain. Construction is going on between the Bellagio and Monte Carlo, and so cranes are also in the picture.  The service is IMPECCABLE. Everything was on perfect cue. We did not have to verbalize additional requests. With subtle eye contact and body language, the waiter decanted additional wine and flawlessly poured the wine in the polished wine glasses. He removed the plates in a timely and quiet manner. The highlight was the complimentary dessert tray. My favorite was the grape jelly coated in sugar crystals.  Oh, the food? It was alright. The foie gras slice was a fairly generous amount. In its rarity, I had farm-raised sturgeon, which I thought could have been warmer than lukewarm.  What really ticked me off was the bathroom attendant who twisted my and my friends' arms for $5 gratuity for a mere three individually wrapped lifesaver breath mints. Turn off.

      I went here for drinks with my family right after I graduated from college. The view at night is spectacular!! I didn't eat dinner here, (yet) but I will update when I do, however the service was great and the ambiance was wonderful, it really made me want to go for dinner, when normally I would avoid it thinking it was a tourist trap.  More to come!!

      Pretty pricey, but always a great place to visit in Vegas.  I went here twice (once w/ a bunch of friends, another time w/ my husband), and had great meals both times.  When I went here w/ my hubby it was especially nice since we got to sit in one of the best seats in the house, with a fantastic view of the bellagio fountains (I asked for it when I booked the place on opentable more than a month before, and I can't believe they actually gave it to me).  When I was last there, I had the seared foie gras appetizer, filet topped with foie gras (you can tell I was totally jonesing for foie gras that day), and the chocolate souffle for dessert.  Mmmm...yum.  I know there are probably a lot of fancier and better places in Vegas, but I still think this place deserves 4 stars for a wonderful meal, great service, and an unbeatable view.

      Situated at the upper base of the mock Eiffel Tower, absolutely gorgeous views from just about anywhere you're seated at this place.  I think this is the first French restaurant that I've ever been to. The French may have something against vegans* because there was only one thing on the menu for me to order-the shaved vegetable salad. Good but a little salty-just made me drink more wine.  AMAZING service. I was not the least bit shy to ask our server for some type of vegan option. He was incredibly accommodating and did not raise an eyebrow when I told him absolutely no mushrooms. What I was served with wasn't out of this world (perfectly cooked asparagus, red sauce, and something else that was obviously not that memorable because I can't recall what it was).  However, the server made up for it by offering to bring me fresh berries when everyone else was enjoying their souffles.  *I need to be fair-this place did offer a savory vegetarian crepe that my dad ordered and he said it was outstanding. This is not saying much from a man who ranks his top restaurants as different hospital cafeterias but it did look damn yummy.

      My review will be a tad biased on this one because my best friend's cousin is the manager here.  We went for her birthday back in April, and got the royal treatment.  Her cousin Val, seated us right by the window and we had a great view of the Bellagio water show at night as well as views of the strip.  Like most French food, the portions are small, but everything we tried was delicious, we all sampled different things with no complaints.  The wait staff was very attentive to us and kept bringing us out samples to the table of things the chef had created that night.  After our appetizers, our main meals came and Val added on a couple sides to the menu for us to try.    Sorry I can't remember what we all had to save my life, but all of our main course meals were very yummy and so were the sides!  After our main course, we each ordered a souffle for dessert, Val once again hooked us up and gave us 3 more desserts including the gelato sampler, creme brulee,  and this other thing that I forgot what it was called.  Either way, my best friend, myself and her fiancee were completely stuffed by the time we were done there.  I definately reccomend this place if you're looking for some fancy French food in Vegas!

      It's kind of gimmicky dining at this fake Eiffel Tower overlooking the artificial Bellagio lake. The food good, nothing to complain about, but nothing really stood out to me either. I feel that there are many other restaurants at Vegas that would be much more worth it than here.

      granted the prices are expensive, but what on the strip isn't. a three course meal with a bottle of wine for two will run you $250 - $300. advice: make reservations, come early, and tip the host for the corner table.  if you'd like the souffle for dessert, order it the minute you sit down, the chocolate or grand m. are the best.

      Went up here just for a few drinks.  One of my friends wasnt dressed appropriately and had to put on pants and a jacket that they have at the bottom of the elevator for such situations.  It made the whole thing sooooooooo funny that it didnt even matter that a round of 4 drinks was more than $50 - the view was awesome

      I seriously wanted to avoid coming here, and I really should've after reading some not-so-consistent reviews.  But we were celebrating both of my parent's birthdays, and they were insistent on eating at Eiffel Tower.  (oh well, gotta make the parents happy)  Ok, well let's get started.  As you get off the elevator, you're immediately presented with the kitchen which is actually kind of cool.  The nice lady walks you to the hostess and so far I'm feeling hopeful.  We get seated immediately in a decent booth, but we really can't see much of a view.  I did specially request a nice view, but that didnt work out so well.  The atmosphere was just ok, and kind of on the loud side.  We started off with with the Roasted Foie Gras, White Almond Dusted Sea Scallops and Warm Lobster Salad for appetizers.  The foie gras was good but I've had much better, and the accompanying marinated grapes weren't the best match.  You really need something sweeter to go with the rich flavor of foie gras.  The scallops were cooked perfectly, and the lobster salad was probably my favorite.  At this point you're probably wondering - why 2 stars?  Well, read on my friend...  For entrees, we ordered Filet of Seabass, Venison Chop, Surf and Turf Beef Tenderloin, and the Bone-in Ribeye.  The seabass was cooked just right but the seasoning was non-existent.  The Venison was cooked perfectly as well and we were pretty pleased with that dish.  The Surf &amp; Turf Beef Tenderloin was quite a disappointment.  The crab meat was like a dried out crab cake, and although the tenderloin was cooked perfectly, it had no flavor at all.  It didn't even have a nice char, which definitely makes a good steak.  The ribeye was probably the best entree of them all.  Nice and juicy and actually seasoned well too.  We also had a side order of scalloped potatoes which was a total waste of money.  At this point the food has been just OK and if you look at the prices, it's really not worth it at all.  But I guess it is Vegas and almost all of the high end restaurants are at least $40 per entree (easy).  Am I just spoiled with the quality and service of San Francisco restaurants?  I haven't yet mentioned anything about service yet, but it was just ok at this point.  Nothing like the Dining Room at the Ritz in SF, and our server seemed way too busy with another table that he really didn't come to check up on us at all.  The rest of the staff was fairly attentive, but I would expect way better service for a restaurant like this.   Ah yes, dessert.  My absolute favorite course of any meal.  I'm hoping that my opinion of the restaurant will change with dessert.  Of course like everyone else, we did get suckered into ordering a souffle at the beginning of the meal, so that was already on its way.  So we wait, and wait, and still no dessert menu.  Someone finally brings us new place settings, but still no dessert menu.  Do they not have a dessert menu?  We can't even find our server because he obviously has way too many tables.  Someone finally brings our souffle, and at that point we asked him for dessert menus.  He says he'll bring them right away....yeah right.  The souffle was delicious I must say, and they were kind enough to bring out complimentary desserts to wish my parents a happy birthday.  But where's my dessert menu??! ! At some point I just gave up because I was so annoyed.  Now you know why I give Eiffel Tower Restaurant only 2 stars.  By the end of the meal, I am annoyed that we have a huge bill to pay and we got a less than satisfactory fine dining experience.  I'm really wishing that I had just made reservations at Picasso in the Bellagio or at Guy Savoy instead.  I could've even just gone back to Delmonico's, Michael Mina, Bouchon, Fleur de Lys, all where I've had way better experiences than this.    In conclusion... Food=3 stars Ambiance=3 stars Service = 1 star (pretty much non-existant) Dessert=1 star (for not ever bringing me a dessert menu) Which averages out to 2 stars.

      You take an elevator from the casino floor up to the mid-section of the Eiffel Tower. We got one of the best tables in the entire restaurant! We sat by the window and was dead center for the Bellagio Fountain shows. I think we saw the show about nine or ten times. The only thing missing was the Bellagio music. The food was excellent - I got the Beef Wellington with ratatouille.  The souffles were PERFECT! OMG the souffles were so freaking yummy I was scraping the bottom of the dishes. You must get it! I had Gran Marnier and pistachio. I'm drooling.  Make reservations. Dress up. A lot of the men were with suit jackets and women in cocktail dresses.

      I heard this place was going to be one of the best places to have a romantic dinner in Vegas. After having dinner there, I do not want to go back again! The service was terrible! Maybe it was only us, but there were many things wrong. I have to blame most of my horrible experience on the waiter (who was the oldest man there!). He asked us in the beginning if we wanted their chocolate souffle, and told us that it would take about 30 min-1 hr to make, so he recommended us to order it in the beginning. So, we did. We waited a long time for our main entrees of salmon and filet mignon, but we didn't mind since my boyfriend and I were watching the Bellagio water show almost every 15 min there. I also ordered some scallops that were pretty good for an appetizer. At any rate, a couple behind us arrived 15 min after us, but were served before us. We found out later, as they stopped to eat their food, that they received the wrong order. It was ours, since I overheard them mentioning their sides. It just happened that they ordered the same main entrees as us. The waiter brought it back to the kitchen, and later brought it out (I know it was reheated in the kitchen) and gave it to us! I know this because my dish was overcooked and my side was on my plate! Horrible!   Not only did they get our main entrees wrong, but the dessert didn't come until an hour after our main entree was finished! The waiter kept telling us it would be coming out, and blamed that the oven was broken (when in reality....he FORGOT that we ORDERED IT!).   There was nothing really special about the dishes. I definitely would not go back there again, especially if that waiter is there! I know this restaurant has a long waiting list, but it was not worth the wait in the end.

      This restaurant did not impress me at all. My boyfriend and I had dinner here along with my cousin and her boyfriend and had a reservation next to the windows. When we got there, were were taken to the elevator and once we were taken up and into the restaurant, the first thing you see is the kitchen and the cooks. Uhh...not so romantic?? I was a little annoyed that we did not sit next to the windows like we asked, of course I didn't want to make a big fuss over it. The only view we saw was the blue Paris balloon sign and a little of Bellagio. Again, not impressive. My cousin and I ordered a chicken dish, and the BF's ordered fillet mignon. We also ordered mash potatoes on the side since the dishes did not come with anything but the meat itself. Once our dishes came out, like typical French food, the portions looked like they were meant to be eaten for birds. The fillet mignon was soooo tiny and mind you this dish cost $68 and each side dishes was $8. My chicken was "organic and grown on a special farm" so this explains why it was $38??? The only thing I enjoyed was their desserts. They were absolutely delicious! We had the White Chocolate Banana Elyse and the Raspberry Napoleon, Vanilla Blanc Manger. They had a beautiful presentation, so pretty to eat. Altogether as a group we spent $400 something including drinks and tip. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind paying a lot of money for a great dinner, but this was not a great dinner! Sorry, I will never return!

      You have to wear a suit jacket and make reservations. This I don't appreciate but you know some people enjoy it. You will come out of an elevator and be in the kitchen. I am told this is common for french restaurants. You have to make a turn to get into the restaurant which is dark with lots of windows. Get a window seat.  The waiter will  call you mam or sir.  The service is not that slow and they put some kind of memorable sauce in the dishes. Food was tasty and they have a good wine selection but not enough syrah...some bordeaux........They have some desert they light on fire too. I forget what is called now...fun...pricey though dinner for two was about $275.

      So this is the second night of my friends quater life crisis and also the eve of his birthday.  So of course we end up at the Eiffel Tower Restauarant.  First off you take an elevator up to the restaurant and you head towards the kitchen.  Then to the dining room that over looks the strip (it's not as high as you would think).  We get a table over looing the strip (nice).    Our server comes and asks if we would like to order a bottle of wine, and I said yes of course.  A sommelier comes by and asks what are my preferences.  I don't like reds, nor do I like dry whites.  I said I like the sweeter and fruitier variety.  She comes back with this Sauvignon Blanc I forget what but it had lychee in it.  Oh my God!  The best wine I have ever had and I'm a fool for forgetting the name.    We get our choice of breads and we ordered our food.  I got the Lamb Chop with escarole and potato puree.  MMMMM the sauce that came with it...I would have drunk it till I drowned.  we also ordered Scalloped Potatoes, Mushrooms, and Asparagus with Lemon Jus to share.  All great sides with my meal.  My friend ordered the Steak Au Puoive and was delicious the peppercorn sauce was not as over powering as I would have thought.  Friend number 2 ordered the Chillean Sea Bass with Roasted Vegetables- probably my least favorite but it was still good.  Friend number 3 Pan Seared Chicken with Meyer Lemon Jus and Hari Cot Verts- really good chicken was moist, nothing spectacular though.  Friends number 4 Roasted Wild Salmon with balsamic reduction and roasted figs- interesting dish, lots of flavor, but I have to say I would have enjoyed it a lot more if it was prepared with a different type of fish.  Dessert?  My friend got a shot glass with a Cappaccino Mousse along with chocolate caligraphy saying Happy 25th Birthday!  Forever tormenting his demise of turning 25 in his quarter life crisis.  That alone made this dinner worth it.   Total= 475.46 plus we tipped the sommelier nicely on what was simply the best wine I ever had.

      Just to let you know, most of the restaurants I've been to have a drive through, so fancy pants places really don't impress me. The hope is that the food is good, the service excellent, yadda yadda.  And in my book, this place is just okay -- especially considering the prices.  First off, we didn't really make reservations, so they sat us away from the windows facing that way cool Bellagio water show. The date asked about it, and the fancy-pants hostess make some comment that was like "oh, those seats are for reserved guests."   Okay, whatever, you lose a star for not seeing a couple that was willing to pay for the place.  Now I actually thought the walk past the kitchen was cool, because it was SPOTLESS. Not bad. You get back part of a star.  The service was pleasant, but I thought a bit over-frenchified like they were trying too hard to be French without them being French. If you have a French restaurant and you expect people to pay $90 a person, they better speak French. You lose another star, my friend.  The duck was a bit "tough", and figuring this was a fancy pants Paris restaurants, you would think that the duck would have been better. The venison was good. The date had a souffle. It was cool how they poured the sauces in, but the souffle wasn't "top notch."  Nice place? Sure, can't beat the view, it you get one of those tables.  Would I go back? No. This is one of those enforced fancy restaurants for the masses -- bring in the celebrity chef to create a menu, and serve high priced average food to people that don't better.

      Okay, I just have to say that if anyone gave this restaurant less than 5 stars then that is because they were in the casino gambling and were depressed because they lost the money that they were going to use on dinner. LOL :)  This is my absolutely positively favorite place to have dinner in the United States! (Sorry, the restaurant in the real Paris are to die for and no comparison but let's focus on U.S.) Every time I fly to Vegas I just have to have dinner here. We definitely get the royal treatment. The view is stunning. If you make reservations around 530pm, hope that they seat you at the window and you can watch the sun setting while the water show is playing at The Bellagio and sipping on some wine. The wine is a bit pricey, but they have some reasonably priced bottles. (Look for Justin's Vineyard from Paso Robles-Cabernet Sauvignon) I think is was about 60 bucks (grt price for that particular restaurant) and the wine is excellent.  Try the Filet Mignon and the Asparagus in a carmelized butter sauce. Ok, I am getting hungry now.

      My friend and I spent well over $200 on lunch here including the very good wine. Yes you too can spend $200 on lunch if you should feel the desire. The service is near unmatched and superb, however the some of the food is not quite worth the price. This is another example of hype in vegas, but I will say that over all it is a wonderful place to go if you have the money to spend. the wine list is probably top five in Vegas so it's really more of a reason to stop by. I must admit that I personally took great pride and got far too much joy out of crumbling bread onto the table while no one was looking, just to see the buss boy attendee come running with his tiny crumb cleaning tool. I seriously did that like three times, (he he he).   CHAD

      My sister and I had dinner here last night (on her company's dime, thank god) and were hugely disappointed.  We sat near the window...with barely a view of the strip.   It's really not that high up, so I wasn't incredibly impressed by the view people keep yapping about.  If you want an amazing view, I suggest the Top of the World restaurant at the Stratosphere instead.  For ambiance, I'd give it 4 stars.  It was nice although sound from other tables really carries well.    Let's talk about the food since that's the most important part about the experience.  Ok, for a place this expensive, I don't expect good.  I expect damn good.  And damn, it wasn't good.  For bread, it was typical crusty baguette, multigrain, or sourdough.  Nothing to write home about.  To start off, the menu had enough choices, but we didn't see anything that really stuck out.  Yes it's a fancy French restaurant, so I expected to not know what half the words meant, but come on, you don't have to make the menu sound so pretentious!  Anyway, as an appetizer ($20), the escargot was quite nice, better than Mon Ami Gabi downstairs and was much better than either of our entrees: Wild Red Snapper &amp; Duck 2 Ways.  My fish was light and delicate, cooked in grapeseed oil.  It was served over really buttery swiss chard, onions, and broccolini.  For $40, I expected my taste buds to be dancing and begging for more.  They weren't.  My sister's $40 duck was (as the named implied) cooked 2 ways...confit (fancy way of saying fried) and roasted to a medium rare.  The confit lacked favor and moisture.  It was definitely over cooked.  I prefer the duck hanging in the windows of Chinatown hole in the walls over this any day.  The roasted duck was better...although a little too rare for my taste.  It was served over a mix of wild rice, braised turnip and other fancy stuff I can't pronounce.  It tasted fine but again I wasn't jumping up and down.  We also ordered  a side of the sauteed wild mushrooms, which were yummy.  But not worth 9 bucks.  We skipped dessert because nothing sounded that appealing.    Service was your typical upscale restaurant service...nice, prompt, but unmemorable.  If I had actually paid for the meal, I would feel totally ripped off.  I've had my fair share of nice fancy restaurants with spectacular views, but this place is needs to work on making it's food more approachable and frankly, good. Overall, I think the place itself is nice...especially for a special outing, but for the food and the price you'd pay for it, go elsewhere.

      I did NOT enjoy myself here at all.   Not every seat in the house has a good view. Service was spotty at best.   they ask for your CC number to make reservations and will charge u if you dont show up....   after being seated in our seats with no view i wanted to leave but feared being charged.  I dropped over 230.00 for dinner for 3 and felt ROBBED   small portions!!! to say the least. food was a 6-10 bartenders were not friendly and rather talk among them selfs than serv.  If i were to do it again i would just go there for Drinks look around and Leave don't give this place your money.

      I love Paris, I also love the Eiffel Tower- so when I was in Vegas for the first time and the Family I was with needed an idea for dinner- I suggested reservations at The Eiffel Tower Restaurant.   While a bit pricey, it is definitely worth it. The view we had was AMAZING (Belliagio light show allll night), the food was good, and ambiance *magical*.  I feel it was perfect for the group we had, and probably also for couples, I wouldn't come here with a bunch of Girlfriends though.

      Eleven guys in Vegas for a bachelor party/weekend.  We entrust one of them to pick a place for our one nice dinner there.  We figure he'd choose a nice steakhouse.  Instead he goes with French... Odd choice but since the bachelor was fine with it we all agreed.  To me, French restaurants present an atmosphere of romance and a classy dining experience.  Not a place where guys can get rowdy, stuff themselves, and down some beer.  We just had to be on our best behavior.  Despite my reservations, I had a wonderful dining experience.  Our menu was laid out in front of us.  I believe it was a pre-fixed menu or perhaps my friend chose the courses.    We started with White Almond Dusted Sea Scallops, Potato Galette, and Tarragon.  Scrumptious.  Up next, Romaine Lettuce and Poppy Seed Tuile.  ::chomp::chomp::  Done.  My buddy Andy sitting next to me doesn't eat veggies.  "Hand it over buddy!" Our main course - Surf and Turf - Beef Tenderloin w/ Lump Crab Crust.   Highly recommended.  We paired our meal with a 1.5 L bottle of Zinfandel.  Lastly, the Creme Brulee was just okay.  A bit too sweet even for a sweet tooth like myself.   Portions were bigger than what I expected for a French restaurant.  Service was excellent.  Our server was attentive and patient.  I hadn't even paid attention to the view.  I was too busy eating and jib jabbering.  HOWEVER, my friends and I nearly had a coronary when the bill arrived.  The breakdown came out to $170 per person...  OUCH.

      Ambiance = 5/5 Food 3/5  My group and I got seats right next to the window that oversaw the Bellagio Hotel. Amazing view! The servers all wore 3-piece suits which was very classy.  The food was pricey and not very good. I think of it as us paying for the view. I shared a steak and lobster, which were both...just okay. The only thing that is really worth mentioning is their chocolate souffle - it was the best souffle I've had to this day.   I would go back for the view and the dessert. :)

      My gf and I had one of the most romantic dinners here.  The view is fantastic and make sure to request a table close to the window.  All the reviewers have already mentioned the spectacular view esp with the Bellagio fountain light show, but keep in mind that they will stop the show if it gets too windy (and it gets windy in vegas all the time).    The food is good.  We had the froe gras which was good (but not as good as I expected) and I had the rack of lamb which was very yummy.  My gf has the filet mignon which was cooked to perfection as well.  Their souffle is good and it has so many flavors to choose from (Chocolate, Grand Marnier, Pistachio, Banana and more).    Their wine list is very extensive and very reasonably priced I thought.  This is one of the few restaurants that server one of my favorite "cheaper" cab that I like (Justin's Orphan)

      The drinks were great. Expensive, but worth the price. The view was great, but the food...eehhh...not so impressed. Expected more at those prices.
