      The Tropicana is an old school Las Vegas hotel on the strip, where it's not hard to find rooms for less than $100 a night. The rooms are clean and comfortable and the decor is a bit dated, but I found that part of the charm. During the summer, there's a swim-up black jack table at the pool-- the perfect spot to while away the midday hours. Gambling is a bit less expensive here than other places on the strip -- and during the day $5 black jack and craps are common. A group of us who stayed here all agreed we'd definitely stay again.

      To be fair, I would definitely classify it as serviceable, but I guess I was hoping at least for a touch of vegas razzle dazzle, even if a bit faded.  The Tropicana seemed less golden age than golden girls--all the way down (up?) to the rattan-framed mirror over the bed.  Maybe this place is better appreciated in warmer weather when the lagoon-like pools are open.

      This casino is really really sad and outdated, HOWEVER, you must try to see the new exhibit, "Bodies."  It's so great to have something like that in town.  I really enjoyed the Titanic exhibit as well, though it was a bit too expensive.   I think that I saw Bob Dole in the casino! Woo!

      A place that let's the average joe enjoy Vegas!  Yeah, it doesn't have the ritz of the other resorts but who needs ritz when you're looking for the dollar!!  There are some nice parts... domed stained glass ceiling and decent pool.  It's a little cheesy compared to all the renovated Strip spots but I love me some cheese once in a while!   The $5 tables and the consistent cocktail service are ideal when you're just looking to play a few hands and have some fun without breaking the bank.  I tend to get a little cranky when I loose money... at the Trop, you have to try twice as hard with that low ante!  And the entertainment!  At 3am, you'll find every type of escort imaginable in the most outrageous outfits... all scoping the joint for the drunkest dope with a wallet.  Who'd go to a lame show when you've got that?!  Classic Vegas, if you ask me.

      This casino exudes a sadness that cannot be surmounted by any number of comps.  Literally, walking through the casino floor en route to the BODIES exhibition caused a sullenness that the much anticipated dissected, respectfully presented cadavers could not surmount.

      Imagine the worst smell possible.  Now imagine that ten times worst surrounding the very air you breathe, burning your nostrils as it enters your body.  The staircase outside our room had the worst smell known to mankind.  And everyday, it seemed liked the smell would grow stronger, and stronger.  Smelled like some drunk crazy person urinated all over the staircase.  And then some animal died there, and that same crazy person urinated all over that too.  Everytime we used those stairs, we would hold our breath praying that we would make it out alive.  Anyways, the hotel is.. eh.  Parking sucks.  The rooms are old.  The elevators will scare the crap out of anyone who's claustrophobic.  Thing is tiny and moves slower than a turtle climbing up stairs.    The casino... the air is filled with nothing but smoke.  I felt sick everytime I had to walk through it.    Plus side... they're going to destroy the hotel and build a brand new one.

      The cheap blackjack table was a good introduction to table gambling, though I think saying they have 24/7 $5 blackjack and only having 1 table was a bit cheap of them. Hotel part was adequate, though a good price, and would have been better if they didn't have the fire alarm combined with worst security/emergency preparedness ever.   Also the champagne brunch buffet really really sucked.

      My boyfriend and I got an amazing deal on Orbitz for $50.00 per night at this hotel.  When we got there, however, we realized we wouldn't have payed a penny more for it, for it was one of those rooms that just made you feel dirty.  There were oh-so-classy mirrors on the ceiling and I think there were blood stains on the tikki couch.  Not only that, the POOL was CLOSED.  I would think that would be the main draw for this shack, and there were people swimming in the INDOOR part while the rest of us layed around on the lawn chairs like beached whales, stairing at the germ-encrusted waters that had not yet been prepped for the season.  About an hour in to our sunbathing, a boy with a tropicana shirt came over peddling his towels on us, which incidentally, looked like the dish towels that they used in the kitchen last night, and were not much bigger, i'd wager.  It took about four of them to cover the chair under me, and I had to be careful to avoid the brown stains.

      It seems everyone gets suckered into staying here once...usually sharing one room with many people, as if the rates weren't already cheaper other hotels on the strip.  But the rooms are cheap for a reason.  Dingy, grimy, run-down and sad.    If you really can't afford anything else and you plan to spend your whole trip to Vegas sloshed, then perhaps you won't notice that the casino and rooms are both run down and not worth your money.  Just keep your shoes on in your room unless you want to actually commune with the crunchy yet oily feeling carpet.  If you're not going to heed my warning, at least you should know that I've heard the rooms in the newer tower are nicer than the original building (it would be hard for them to be worse).  On the plus side, its close to MGM.

      Wow, so far everyone is in agreement that the tropicana is not the greatest place. Although, I did stay in the suite for $85. You have to ask if they can upgrade you in casinos, the worst they say is no. My complaint about tropicana is well, I do not listen to directions beyond the first thing someone says. Hey, I am a guy. So, it took me about 2 hours to find my hotel room. The problem is no one cares to help you. I showed them my room number, and everything they still could not help me. I stayed here for one night only, because mandalay bay was $225 for the first night and $125 for the remaining 2 nights. It's tough to pay more when you can get the same thing for less the next day.

      The rooms are cheap, that's for sure.  You also get what you pay for.  Bad location.  Bad rooms.  Bad upkeep.  No other amenities.  OK pool.  Not worth a more in depth review.

      As bad a rap as this place gets, I found it just fine this past weekend, given low price vs. the other schwanky hotels around town.  Let's face it, you're up all night anyway!  Who cares!    We stayed in the "Paradise Tower" part of the hotel, and actually had a nice room!  The view of the strip was good (room 618 to be exact), and the bathroom was pretty big (good for a couple of gal pals getting ready).    I also stayed here this past new year's eve, and it wasn't as nice, but I was in a different part of the hotel.  It was maybe the garden area?  Who knows...they did have a clogged pipeline issue that time which was gross,  however they fixed it right away and the staff were all pleasant.    I think Trop gets a bad rap when its not all that bad given price and location.  You can hop on the tram right across the street at the MGM and check out whaveter schwank hotel you like.  Its cheap and close to things!  And its OLD school, which is pretty cool.    Oh yeah, the karaoke bar is cheesy and fun, old school style.  We sang a few numbers.  The MC likes to think he's got mad skills, as in breaking into a Doors song in between guests on stage.  That's a no no whe you have a stack full of napkin requests.  The MC unspoken rule is only to sing when you have a dearth of entries.  But no, he had to break into the Doors midstream.  Poor dude, wookin pa nub in all the wrong places.    Long live the old school Trop.

      Stayed here and it did have the lowest price out of all hotels on the strip and I now know why.  This place is so run down it's not funny.  Our toilet sprayed water all over the place.  Toilet paper roll was hanging off wall, and it looked like a blind person re-grouted the place.  Bedside lights didn't work, slider took an act of god to open.  This place is completly run down and is in need of renovation.  I will not stay here agian until they rebuild.

      I have been here 3 times, first time I got a "Garden Pool Room" (cheapest) and I don't really commend it, its kind of old looking, very small bathroom also.  The other 2 times I have stayed at a "Tower Room" ,wish is just one step up from the Garden Room, but man! what a difference, I did like this room (of course nothing fancy) but its nice, comfy, spacious, clean and even has mirrors on top of the bed... nice! You can see some pics of the room here: http://www.taniayvlady.com/Album23/Vegas_Junio_2007_005.html  The pool here is awesome the best after some from the upscale Hotels, if you are watching your budget but the pool is a bid deal then theres is no better choice for you then this Hotel, believe me.  Don't worry about the location, its actually a great location (IMO) you are connected via a bridge (casino to casino) to the MGM and get there within just minutes, a very small walk.

      Hookerville!!!  Beware of this hotel. I think they pimp hookers that hang out in the hallways. We were there for 2 nights and saw the same girls both nights. They hang out in the lobby hallways and you'll see them on the way to your room.. "--Wanna have a good time?" We tried to complain to the management on our check out. They were total jerks about it.. didn't really care at all. Treated us like we were lying about it. The decor is run down and it does look like dirty.  I would never stay there again...  The pool opens at 10 and closes at 6. People smoke and drink inside the pool.  There is no security anywhere to be found and if you complain they just don't care...  DON'T STAY HERE! (I know, it's cheap but it's not worth it)  Check in lines are a pain and the panoraic elevators had broken windows (they were so dirty you could barely see the view).. Falling apart wall paper and ripped carpets are everywhere... Nasty!  Really, go somewhere else...

      Anyway I stayed here last weekend as I was going with a group of friends from college (16 of us to be exact) and we wanted to stay in a place on the strip for cheap. Hey at $49 a person (4 per room) total for 2 nights...sounds like a sweet deal to me.   Well at Tropicana you really do get what you pay for.  The room size was standard, and it appeared to have the same amenities as most casinos.  However, the rooms did definitely feel much older and dirtier than most casinos. Yes, as if you were in a Motel 6 but on the strip.  The beds also were crapped out slanted and with broken springs.  In Vegas you probably only sleep 4 hours a day, so I could deal w/that. but what made the place suck for me was that the shower had horrible pressure, came out at a weird angle, and couldn't stay a constant temperature for longer than 10 seconds.    The casino is also kind've run down, but they do have 24-7 $5 tables that aren't nearly as packed as places like Slots of Fun..so that's a plus. The pool is decent as well, but watch out for who strolls around your stuff (someone tried to steal my friend's hat), as there is no security for who goes to the Tropicana pool.  BTW the check-in line is really not as bad as the others below are saying. My group came in around 10pm friday night (somewhat peak time)..and we got are 4 rooms checked in in less than 20 minutes..so I don't know WTH everyone else was talking about for 2 hours?!?        This place is no way in hell Bellagio, but it doesn't deserve 1 star either like so many of the elitest losers who try to review this place expecting it to be the Bellagio. Tropicana does have a good location on the strip, and it is priced very cheap. However, given the room/pool quality and feel of the casino..unless you are absolutely trying to save bottom dollar..I'd definitely recommend staying else..as the overall value of room/location/service/casino  per dollar at places like MGM, NYNY, Planet Hollywood, Bally's, etc.  is just so much better and definitely worth the extra $20-50 a night. ~G p.s. the "smell" everyone is talking about at Tropicana is a mixture of old building and smoke. It's not horrible, but it's definitely a lot stronger at the Tropicana than at other Casinos.  My nose was definitely plugged the entire weekend, but i'm not a smoker.

      The Trop will always be special to me. At all cost, pay the extra few bucks to stay in the Paradise tower. Its exponentially better than any Garden Room and the toilet will actually flush.   For gamblers, the blackjack tables have really cool Eritrean dealers who are fair with their game.   The pool is by far the nicest amenity. Unlike other locales where shade comes with a price, the Trop has lovely trees sprung all around the pool's borders to offer the palest of the pale temporary respite from the harsh sun.

      At the Copa, Copa Cabana, they fell in love..." sang Barry Manilow in 197.. I know this is the Tropicana not the Copa Cabana but I couldn't help think of this song as this place had a similarly ending name, similar cheesiness that I associate with Manilow and a style that seems stuck in the end of the 70s.  In fact the Tropicana doesn't look like it's had a touch up since 1979.  Paint is peeled, signs long washed out, a certain aqua, chiseled quality to the pool.  Most of the staff weren't around in the 70s.  It's like many a job, especially by the pool and fitness area are reserved for local junior college students with their first Strip job.  The disgruntled generation next meets put upon yet whatever saying high school attitude is pervasive in any interactions.    While other pools send their hottest staff out to wait on you at the pool and welcome you to their Spa and/or Fitness center, the Tropicana makes clear they have surrendered any hope of being chic, hip or worth a high price.  So the room was cheap and while not in the middle of the strip as I was informed, well located against the much more together and fun seeming MGM.   With the cheapness however, comes an opportunity to upgrade to the tower "wowee" and here is where you can then pay another $14 for wireless.  The basic rooms have dial up.  Wha that?  If you look at the positive, it has an old skool charm and a major plus was the surprisingly large round tub that was perfect for soaking in after nights on the dance floor and morning taxi rides back from various places on strip.

      I have stayed at most of the hotels on the strip before. Tropicana is not really that bad.   The place gets old, I agree, but for its location and its price. It is affordable and it doesn't break your wallet. I remember staying at 1 of the towers and got a pretty good view of the strip. For less than $60/day/on the strip, you can't beat that.   And I don't see why Circus Circus gets more stars than "the Trop."

      OLD. Yes, everything about this place is old.  I think most of the waitresses were there when it opened. The only way I could get my husband to agree to go to Vegas to see a UFC fight was if I kept the price under a certain amount.  Our options were to stay on Fremont street or one of the cheapies on the strip.  I opted for Tropicana due to the location.  We've stayed at the Mirage, the Paris and yes those casinos are better, newer and cleaner - but the Trop really was fine for the price.  The pool is awesome, we had our best day right there grabbing Long Islands from the swim up bar.  The bars at the pool closed too early in my opinion though.  They directed us into the casino, going up an elevator and through a casino in a wet suit and flip flops is not fun.  I didn't understand why they closed the bar before the pool, just shut them down at the same time.    Oh and rapid roulette at $2.50 rocks!  We got in on a Thursday and left on a Monday so the line at check in/out was non-existent.  We did see some fierce lines on Friday and Sunday, so try to avoid arriving or leaving on those days and bring patience if you have to.  The room was fine and the bottle opener next to the toilet made me giggle.

      As soon as we walked into our room, I had my boyfriend search under the bed, in the closet, and in the bathtub for a dead hooker. Yeah, it's that kind of place. Super sketchy.   We only stayed here because it was my friends' bachelor/bachelorette party weekend and they wanted us all to stay in the same hotel. What a mistake. Everything about this place is tacky, dirty, and gross. There were mirrors on the ceiling (!) which wasn't so bad until we started thinking of the kind of people who probably had sex in that room. Eww. I'd keep my shoes on at all times. You can probably get pregnant just by walking around barefoot.  On the upside, the Tropicana shops are world-class. You can buy gold by the inch, a cheap rhinestone kitten purse, and a carved wooden Jesus. I wish I was making this up.

      When we left Las Vegas yesterday, we hailed a cab to take us from our hotel to the airport, like everyone does.  And, like every cab driver that we've ever had in Las Vegas, our cabbie was full of questions.  No sooner did we get the cab door shut, and he asked us, "do you guys know when they're going to start tearing down the Tropicana Hotel?"  I have to admit, the first thought that went through my mind was, "hopefully, really soon".  The Tropicana was like flashing back to the late 70's.  The rooms were decorated with rattan furniture, the chairs, the table, the bed... The bed.  The bed had a rattan and mirror headboard that extended all the way up to the ceiling, and continued across the ceiling.  And for clarification, that means there were rattan boardered mirrors along the ceiling, above the bed.  Just think Austin Powers.  The rest of the hotel didn't get any better.  Half of the escalators were broken.  One apparently long enough that the hotel put yellow caution tape strips on the end of every step, I guess so you could see where the edge of the steps were.  But, I will say this.  It's definately the perfect place for the just turn 21ers.  They were running all over the place in their bathing suits with margaritas in one hand, and a "cigarette" and sun tan lotion in the other hand, trying to hold each other up as they stumbled through  the casino.  It was like one long pool party the whole time we were there.    The perfect vacation destination if you plan to spend your whole time in Las Vegas puking drunk.

      Just to warn you, this review is back from 2001 before Yelp was even invented.  But I had to review it because Tropicana holds a special place in my heart for being the first hotel that I ever stayed in in Vegas.  I don't remember a ton about the room, but just that it was a very basic 3 star room and was just fine.  I barely stayed in the room anyway.  The pool is hands down the best part of the hotel.  I loved how you can rent an inner-tube and meander down the wavy pool.  I was sad to hear that they are tearing it down, but times are a-changing, I guess.  Even though my taste in hotels has gotten more and more up-market as time has have gone by, I still have fond memories of Tropicana and really appreciate the fun weekend I spent there years ago.

      This hotel needs to be torn down.  It's way past its prime and not well maintained at all.  The carpet in the hallway is scary, the curtains were this ridiculous flower pattern from 1970 (the bedspreads match the curtains, by the way).  The worst part had to be the dried sperm stain that was left on the blankets.  Nasty. The pool was pretty lame too.  Too crowded...and there were people by the pool smoking pot right in front of children and when a friend of mine went to complain, the pool attendent acted like she didn't even care.   Luckily we didn't spend too much time in the hotel.
