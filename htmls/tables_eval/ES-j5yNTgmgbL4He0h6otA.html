      The owners of one of Munich's most famous institutions, the historic Hofbrauhaus, have lovingly recreated it - across from the Hard Rock Hotel - down to the last detail, complete with beers, steins, and brass bands. Stepping through the front door, you leave behind the arid desert air and glitzy casinos of Vegas as you're transported into a world of schnitzel, ale, and strudel, served in a beer hall with ornately painted columns and ceilings, or an indoor garden with chestnut trees and a fountain, by buxom dirndl-clad waitresses with rosy cheeks. Having been to the original, I can attest to the autheniticy of the look, the feel, and the extensive Bavarian menu here. Liver mousse is served with a pretzel baked with dough flown in from the fatherland on a daily basis. If you like sausage, you must indulge in a wurstplatte, overloaded with Viennese franks, chicken and pork links, creamy mashed potatoes, and imported sauerkraut. Pork roast with dark beer sauce and bread dumplings, fried filet of cod with warm German potato salad, and breaded pork cutlet with cranberries are among the other specialties. Three versions of hofbrau - lager, a premium dark wheat, and a seasonal version - are on tap, and German, Australian, and California wines are available by the bottle or glass. Naturally the atmosphere is loud and festive, as if it's Oktoberfest every day of the year. If you're not part of a group, you probably will be before the night is over. As highly recommended as it is totally unexpected for Vegas.

      good food, but go here for the atmosphere...  having been to the original haus in munchen, this is a bit like going to eurodisney and expecting to be in disneyland.  it looks similar, but it's just not quite right.  nevertheless, i had one of the funniest experiences here for a late lunch.  2 buddies and i were in vegas for a show--stopped in for a stein and some sausages, and we proceeded to be ridiculed by a fraulein from omaha--serious attitude!  it was great.  next, it was octoberfest, and one of my buddies was yanked into part of the german band's act.  i thought i was going to piss in my pants.  anyway, great time, i recommend for a lunch stop.

      Fun place, with a real beer garden and great food.  Open late too.  Beware of the waitresses though, who seem more than happy to try to foist yet another liter upon you, inflating your tab further and further north...

      Very good atmosphere. High ceiling, long wooden benches and real German band playing what appears to be traditional german music.  Forgettable food. The sausages did not any distinct flavor. Taste almost like ball park franks from the supermarket. Black forest cake was more cream than cake. Minus 1 star.  I would come back for the beer, join the band in singing and dancing, but eat elsewhere.

      Prost! Not as huge as the O.G. one in Munchen, but just as fun! Get a 1 Liter beer for 8 bucks and prepare to get wasted!   Nice souvineer shop as well to get replica mugs and other apparel.  At night, fun times are had with entertaining music and everyone in the bar is friendly. I never really ate here, except for a big azz pretzel, as a few of them beers will make you full.

      Ist das nicht ein schnitzlebank?  Hofbrauhaus is a new drinking hall here in Vegas. New as in 3 -4 years old here. Exact replica of the original Hofbrauhaus in Germany. Ok so here's my deal. Location...across from Hard Rock. Ok that's decent if there wasn't so much construction on this street. Parking is in the rear, it's not so bad getting in as long as you don't have old people blocking the walkway to the entrance. GRRRR WALK FASTER OLD PEOPLE!  So the beer is big and bitter served by good strong german women.  Pretty decent, Octoberfest beer. You also have the dark ales and a few different lagers. Seriously...who likes German food. Kraut, Vienerschnitzle which is a breaded pounded peice of meat....sausages...and spaetzle.Bleah. Needs ketchup or somethin. Dessert was a black forest cake. Eh...nothing really popped out at me. The food was eh....beer good. Polka band with a leiderhosin group of Original Polka Gangstas leading the chicken dance to tourists and kids who don't know any better that dance will get their butts kicked in school.  So to experience this German flair, go for it if you want to try a new experience. But I just think Vegas has more to offer than that.

      If you've been to Germany you might be able to appreciate the HB.  If you haven't, it's not worth a special trip unless you're looking for expensive and mediocre food.  Thankfully, it was all good since it was all free...  I visited Sept 2006.  If you're on your way to Munich, don't visit.  Save your appetite for the original.  Pros: + A friendlier gift shop in LV than in Munich + fun, loud, and festive atmosphere + German beer   Cons - the sausages don't seem authentic

      Ha!  Just like Hofbrauhaus in Munchen!  Great time!  We had a nice waitress, great meal, and had a lot of fun reminiscing about our time in Munich nine years ago (has it been that long?).  Although I can no longer drink 5 liters of good German beer, I can revel in the fact that I'm in Vegas sitting in a fake beer garden.  I can also enjoy many varieties of wurst and a good tradtional gemischtem Salat.  Yum....And to think we were going to eat at Nobu.    If you go, try to sit in the beer garden unless you really want the authentic crazy entertainment (including the chicken dance, alpenhorn, and beer drinking songs...do I hear a " Zicke, zacke, zicke, zacke, hoi, hoi, hoi!!!"?)

      4 stars because i only had beer there, but didn't order food even though everything(!) on their menu looked awesomely german.  great place to get a decently priced delicious beer off-the-strip (it's about 0.5 or .75 mi away -- walkable, but take a cab if you're lazy and it's 90+ degrees out).  the beers are delicious!!  and our bartender was friendly and attentive.  the hefeweizen was perfect, in my opinion, with a hint of citrus.  i really should have ordered a whole liter instead of half.  my boyfriend's dunkel was also really yummy even though i wasn't in the mood for a dark brew.  the atmosphere of this place was really chill.  but then again, we were there on a monday night.  bar area in the foyer as well as a gift shop, and a doorway leads to the main dining hall.  picnic-table-style seating from what i could see.

      This was a nice depature from the scene at the Hard Rock. While the food was just okay (the sausages needed a little something extra and the sauerkraut was good with just enough sour), the tall and cold beers are what hit the spot. I enjoyed the Wheat Beer plus the shot of something that my co-worker talked us all into having.  What better way to kick off a business trip and 'bond' with co-workers than raising your beer stein and singing along with the band?

      I first went to this joint when I was in Munich and absolutely loved it.  I don't know what it was, but the bratwurst and sauerkraut, along with a huge stein of beer to wash it down was amazing.  Also, you walk outside and you're in downtown Munich, with all of its culture.  One time when taking a cab back to the Vegas airport, I saw this spot and was again enamored.  On my next trip, my friends and I went there for lunch.  The food and beer was once again top notch.  I think they must fly everything in from Germany or something.  However, the atmosphere was another story.  It didn't have the same energy level that the Munich location had.  Also, their attempts at creating a local experience (having performers on stage) seemed more like Disneyland than actually being in Germany.  To top it off, the location sort of sucks.  While its ok if you want to drive, its pretty far off the strip.  Everyone knows that when you go to Vegas, you want to be right by the strip.  At least the Carnegie Deli was smart in selection a Vegas location right at the Mirage.  But, I digress.....this spot still has great food and beer and one should expect everything in Vegas to be fake.  So, until I have the time to go back to Vegas, this place will definitely suffice.

      Five stars for the mere REMINDER of Munich, beer gardens and Oktoberfest.  I came down from the Double down had a great buzz going already and the waitress served us a couple of rounds and then clocked out without charging us.  5 stars for that alone, the Spaten beer, the liter steins and the band and a great table with some maniac wearing a San Jose sharks jersey.  Prosit, dude! Food, no. This is not a food thing, if you need food, get a pretzel. Las Vegas Uber Alles!!

      My group was looking for sushi and I was recommended to come to Hofbrauhaus to continue my attack on my stomach and liver.  The beer was great, Germans really know how to make beer.  The sausage was good but nothing out of this world.  The warm cranberry was great, I usually hate cranberries, you know the one that you get on Thanksgiving in the mold of a can.  Bottom Line: Come here for the beer and the atmosphere.  The band in their lederhosen was fun, especially when they ask for crowd participation.

      "... you go... I'm never leaving this place."  I'd like to say I rocked the Hofbrauhaus, but in truth, the haus rocked me.  The beer at Hofbrauhaus is flown in from Germany.  Their wheat beer is delicious and among one of the better I've tasted.  Like true German wheat beers, it is served sans fruit.  Huge steins of beer come as soon as you can order them.  The beer drinking ensues at your table and on-stage.  I was here during downtime in Las Vegas, Saturday at 2pm, so the place was far from packed.  The band was a husband-wife team and despite the fact that the beer hall was only sparsely populated, they performed like it was a full house.  With interactive songs that ranged from standing on your bench to pounding your stein on the table to the rhythm of the song, they constantly kept all patrons involved.  I could go on with some of the other tricks they have up their sleeves but I'll let you come here to see them for yourself.  Even after a tough session of playing trumpet and flugelhorn, they still make rounds of the hall and chat with you while taking slugs off their steins.  Both talkative and sapient about the tradition of the Hofbrauhaus, they're even willing to get a little personal.    I had to get them a round of apple schnapps shots before I left, it felt mandatory.

      My first time here I was amazed at how good a job they did in replicating the original in Munich.  The decor is fantastic, and even the celings look the same!  The only difference I noticed is that the original has breathalizer machines in the restrooms, whereas they are conspicuously absent here in Vegas.  :)  You'll just have to guesstimate how drunk you get.  One comes to Hofbrauhaus for the beer, and it certainly does not disappoint.  My favorite is the dark beer, but the wheat beer is the real star:  If you have ever consumed some half-assed American knock off at a wheat beer, you'll see why the brewery even tried!  (I.E. The German stuff is goooooood!!!!).  I've had a few food items here, and they were good.  I woudl highly recommend the 1/2 chicken with potato salad.    When this place is rocking, the atmosphere is the best.  The table setup and beer hall format really liven the place up.  You are likely to be seated next to folks you don't know, so half the fun is making friends while drinking copious amounts of beer.  The bar area up front is a bit more chill, and you can even watch the game on the 3 plasmas.  They also have a back dining area that is more suitable to families (it is away from the Polka band and not filled with drunken idiots like me).

      Dude, this place is the schnitzel!   Awesome German grub, pretty blond waitresses in authentic German garb (and they're nice, too!), and pretty much all the weiners and spaetzel you can eat. Cheap for the amount of everything you get, too.   There's a live band most evenings, and it can be a little hard to hear, but that's why they serve massive quantities of beer. They WANT you to yell at the top of your lungs, get all red in the face, overheat, and then barf in the bathroom. Yes, yes, I did. But the bathrooms are right next to the lovely beer garden, so be sure to poke your head in there for a peek.   Love this place. Love it!

      Coolest place in Vegas!!!  It's so much fun...very good for birthdays and big groups...but only if you want to go and sing, drink, and dance...not if you want to talk.  It's a bit loud for talking.  Steins are $12.  The big pretzels (OMG, so good) with fixins are also $12, which is a must have.  We didn't have much room for dinner so we split the half roasted chicken...which I think was also $12.  Bill with tax and tip came out to $80+ for two....man, those steins add up!!  :)

      Exact replica of the Hofbrauhaus in Munchen! Except that the outdoor beer garden is not really outdoor. I need to dig out my pictures from Germany because it was so similar, I felt like I was teleported back in time to one of my fun trips through Europe.   My co-worker and I were transported back and forth past this place on the way to the Convention Center and when it was time to eat, we agreed to check this place out. It's diagonal from Hard Rock and huge - hard to miss.   In the front there is a cute gift shop w/ cheesy souvenirs like beergarden girl aprons and the huge steins w/ the Hofbrauhaus logo. We were greeted by a friendly German man who smiled and asked if we'd like to be seated next to some good-looking men. Haha - the tables are large and you will sit (if you're in a small party) with other parties. Unfortunately, no one was there (men anywhere near our age) so we were seated next to a grandma w/ her teenage granddaughter who was apparently applying for a job. The band was playing in their leiderhausen, beers in hand. Great atmosphere.  We started with a jumbo Oktoberfest pretzel that came with a tasty spread on the side, and mustard. Great starter! I'm not a huge beer fan, but had to get one to be in the mood. It came in a big ol' mug - it was their version of hefeweizen. I wasn't lovin' it, but I drank it anyway.  For my meal I ordered the Majoram - veal bratwurst and it came with red cabbage and mashed potatoes. I had to get some spaetzle on the side, but it was flavorless and disappointing. The red cabbage, which I didn't really want, was good. The bratwurst, also good. We also got sauerkraut and that was good as well and served warm. My coworker got this inappropriately large sausage sandwich - the HB Riesenbratwurst. We had to take pics b/c it was so long and huge. Hilarious. She was hammin' it up.  No room for dessert, but my coworker had to have some German schnapps - completely different from American schnapps. I was blown away by how potent the pear one was, but the apple was good. And strong.  By the end of the night we were stuffed. I don't recommend this for dinner before going clubbing. Better for the day of your flight home so you can waddle around and sit.

      This place is fantastic!  The first time I went, I was concerned that it would be an imitation of the original.  Not the case.   The beer is great, and the food is spot-on.    The atmosphere is better in Munich, as the building is older, etc.  But this is a great recreation without having to fly all that way.

      I have been here several times and the food keeps me coming back.  Not to mention all the house beers on tap.    It was someones birthday the last time we went so that made the band extra lively.  We walked out full, buzzed, and with bags of souvenirs.  This is one of the main reasons why I travel to Las Vegas now.

      Oktoberfest all year round!  I'm not a beer drinker but I find myself downing a liter of beer whenever we go to Hofbrauhaus.  It's just so fricken' good!  Such a fun environment with live music and waitresses with the cutest bar maid outfits.  I totally forgot that I was part of the minority because everyone was so warm and friendly.  Definitely a cool place to bring the tourists.

      WOO-HOO! Hofbrauhaus!!!! This place is such a great time! People are singing, dancing and drinking beers that are heavier than my head. They have a german band, german beer girls, and lots and lots of german beer. I had so much fun here, and I met that crazy lookin fool from West Coast Customs, you know that guy with all of those piercings in his face. Good times.   I take off one star, because the food. The food is not so good.

      This place is a riot. We were there on a Friday night and it was going OFF.   We walked into the enormous beer hall with people dancing on the tables, weaving around the room in dancing chains and singing at the tops of their lungs. The band looked like a traditional German band, but instead of belting out the German classics that no one knows, they were belting out Neil Diamond and other classic American hits that we all know and can sing too.   There were chugging contests and the lederhosen clad star waiter laid down on his back, on a table and played a 10 foot  Ricola style horn - I am not kidding.  The beer is awesome and the food is yummy and authentic, albeit a little mass-produced.  If you want some good ol' Bavarian beer hall fan, I can't think of a better place to go outside of the real thing. They really went all out replicating the original.

      I have to admit, I went here with high expectations after reading Yelpers praise this place. I'm sorry folks, but it was just way too German for me. I know that to most that is the charm of the place, its authenticity, German food, music, etc. and what did I expect of a place called Hofbrauhaus! But, I couldn't overcome my English squeamishness about Germanic culture! Yes, the beer was cold and tasty, although the selection was limited to 3 choices. Food was ok, plain and filling. The band was very pleasant and eager to entertain. Some of the band members were so young they couldn't even drink beer (at least not in the US). The crowd was not too into the music so it was a pretty subdued atmosphere. So, go here if you are really into German food and culture otherwise go somewhere else. Should have gone to Crown &amp; Anchor instead!!

      I went to dinner here, since I had never been to a German restaurant before.  The food was very good, and pretty reasonable.  The only compliant that I had about the food is it was delivered very fast (10-15 minutes after we ordered it).  In addition, the servers seemed to be in a bit of hurry (running around a lot).  However, the noise level in the main dining room was deafening.  I was expecting it to be loud, but not rock concert/club level loud.  After 5 minutes, I asked my server if we could move to the beer garden.  She was very polite, and allowed us to move there.  I could still hear the live music, but it least it was at a reasonable volume.  So, if you are either drunk, crazy, or hard of hearing (or a combination thereof), you'll enjoy the main room.  However, if you don't fit into any of those categories, then you will find the beer garden to have a much better environment.  If you don't like to hear lively music at dinner, don't go to Hofbrauhaus.

      Looking back, I realize I was trying to do the impossible. I went here  hoping that it would be a genuine replica of that famous Bavarian brewery that first introduced me to beer. I went here with visions of pork shoulder, giant soft pretzles, and, of course, liters of delicious beer.  I guess one out of three ain't bad.  This Hofbrauhaus isn't much to look at outside, but once you step in the dining hall, you realize very quickly what you're getting into. The setup is very true to the original: high celings, an oompah band, and short skirted waitresses. Slowly, however, things started seeping in. The closest thing that the band came to a genuine German song was the 'chicken dance'. I looked all around for those big pretzles that compliment their beer so much, only to find out that the pretzle that comes with your meal is of the small, hard variety.  I was very dissapointed at the size of the portions, too. My girlfriend got a sausage entree &amp; it came with a minimum of sides: a pretzle. We had to share my plate, the 'Schweinebraten'.  The food was good, but I really expected more. Aren't German dishes supposed to fill you up?  I was very satisfied with the beer, though. It tasted like it did three years ago, and they stick to the original or dunkel. When it comes to beer, you don't come here for variety, you come for quality.  Also, it was really loud, so don't come here expecting a nice, quiet dinner with your sweetheart.  To recap: The food was good, but a ripoff, the beer was great, &amp; the atmosphere mediocre at best. I know I set the bar high, but even with that factored in it wasn't that great of an experience. Would I come back? Only if someone else is paying.

      So a friend was saying that he wanted to visit this place during this past trip to CES.  While waiting at baggage claim at LAS, I saw an ad for the place on the humongous TV screens, and it looked like a lot of fun.  So we decided to make a trip out there, and were definitely not disappointed.  Although I don't necessarily like loud places, this was still a lot of fun, and it was amazing that for the 2 hours we were there, the band never seemed to stop, and they just kept going on and on with barely a pause, playing lively music, playing games, starting a conga line, etc.  But more than just the entertainment, which was definitely a lot of fun, the food was also excellent.  I was surprised that I was able to scarf down a plate that had a sausage, pork cutlet, some other pork cut, mashed potatoes, and sauerkrat so quickly!  It was damn tasty, and I washed it down with a stein of beer.  It probably also explains my weight gain after this last trip to Las Vegas... :D
