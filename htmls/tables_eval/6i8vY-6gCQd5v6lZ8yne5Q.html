      Got to take a tour of the property and I must say I like it. The layout of the casino is great and super easy to navigate . Sayers club is my favorite look out of the clubs. But the other clubs are cool as well. Also being the foodie I am the restaurants I can't wait to open. Especially the bazaar meat by jose andres.

      3.5 stars.  I Was treated to a soft opening on "play day" and received a wonderful tour from the VIP host.  The LIFE club looks great and FOXTAIl provides a more intimate social club setting where live music will be featured.  Sayers Club is a great look and you must check it out.  The food choices are varied and Bazaar Meats looks great.  I was able to sample the buffet and Umami burger.  The buffet is solid but on the smaller side of things and with nothing that really stood out as unique.  Umami burger was tasty and I look forward to a return visit to sample more of the menu.  Umami also houses the sports book and has a large patio.  I wish I could have tried all the other places (800 degrees, Griddle Cafe, etc) but it is more reason to go back.  The decor is very modern with video screens, large photos of old school vegas black and whites, and a small but very packed casino floor.  All the latest games are there, both table and slot.  The pool has a swim up bar and a large staging area but overall was on the smaller side.  I was not able to see the rooms.  The SLS seems to be focused on the movers and shakers and is priced accordingly.    I was very impressed by the staff who are very team oriented and seem to be very proud of their roles with SLS.    In fact, my only real negative about this place is that the functional casino is small, the restaurant seating is small, the sports book is very small... whether this works as an intimate setting or becomes too small for the crowds it will draw remains to be seen.  I will return to update my review in a few weeks, after they have settled in.

      If I could give 0 stars I would. All the hype and the money was a waste.  This place looks like a dingy hole in the wall.  Everything's very plain which doesn't scream that they spent any money on this place just a lot of gray and black spray paint. The employees didn't know anything and the place was overpacked. There was no games available to even gamble on.  If I did drink I wouldn't have been able to get one because there was maybe 2 cocktail waitresses and they were only catering to the high end tables. The worst experience in any hotel in Vegas.  Go over to the golden nugget the have way more to offer at half the price.

      Nice hotel.  Definitely for a young crowd appealing to people looking for a hotel with a modern style with a urban/metro edge.  I think this compares to the level of the NYNY or Monte Carlo hotel and casinos. Not quiet the level of the Cosmopolitan.  Definitely has cool and accessible restaurants.

      I'm a huge fan of the SLS Beverly Hills, so naturally, I was very excited for sbe to open their flagship property...wait for it...in my hometown! I attended the grand opening last night with a close friend, and was blown away by the design of the property. The lobby is gorgeous- classic Starck, with elements of the hotel in Beverly Hills built in. The flower bouquets that became so infamous in LA are prominently on display here. It's obvious that the staff cares a lot about the property. I'm excited to see how the hotel impacts the North end of the Strip. I hope they are very successful, because with this restaurant collection, Fred Segal, and designer rooms...at these prices, they should be. Nightly. Pics to come...

      I am definitely not impressed with this place. They don't have their stuff together, the ambience is too chaotic, and the crowd  drawn to this place is absolutely classless. Their restaurant staffs should  be retrained so they're not running around like headless chickens. No desire to come back here.

      Amazing to be apart of the private grand opening celebration last night!!! I love the new SLS on the North end of Las Vegas. What an awesome job they did with remolding the old run down Sahara. This place is so hip I can't get enough. The stylish trendy vibe brings a complete upgrade to this side of the strip. I haven't seen the rooms yet but everything else is phenomenal. I am so stoked that Vegas is spreading the wealth and not keeping all the good stuff in one corner. Lots of cool bars with an up beat and very upscale atmosphere. I am very please and I can bet you would be too.

      Highly anticipated, highly disappointed. I walked from my residence to the front entrance. I was greeted with a slew of discarded beer cans, beer bottles and plastic cups strewn along the walkway. Upon entry, I noticed the carpet was covered with something maybe a farm animal may have left behind (disgusting.) I signed up for their players club weeks ago only to discover I would have to wait in line for two hours to receive the card. What did registering on line gain me? I informed the concierge that I was a local and that I had registered on line. To bad so sad go stand in the two hour line. I think not. I had planned on an afternoon of gaming and dining. I will spend those dollars at other properties that know the value of locals.

      Sls,  the old Sahara,  sucks, elevators to the garage don't work, had to walk up six flights of stairs,  the line for slot cards was a mile long. Granted,  it was the first day open, but the system that they have is old and and inefficient. Won't ever come back to the SLS.  What's SLS stand for ? Stupid Limousine Service ? And the dealers have monkeys on their backs,  no, they aren't junkies.

      Went a few hours after the midnight opening. At 5 there were a lot of people still there from the opening, maybe coming from one of the clubs?  Because I am an old fogey, my first thought was "tragically hip".This is a place that definitely was not set up for my generation.  And I think that is a good thing.  It is a smaller casino and once things shake out, I think it could get a following of the 20 - 30ish crowd. The casino is on the small side, but it does create a nice intimate experience.  The food venues are off the casino floor and sound like they have interesting items, but come prepared to pay. They aren't to proud to charge you that arm and leg. The Griddles cafe l was told,  is a big thing in LA but I didn't think the pancakes were any more special than what I could make at home. As I said, I am not there target sudience, but despite it all, I know I will return for the restaurants.

      Interesting observation of the reviews: almost all of the Las Vegas locals gave the place poor rating, and most of the out of towners loved this place! Dunno what this really means, but it seemed interesting,  maybe the expectations are different...  Anyway, I attended the opening party and had a blast.  The food at the bazaar meat was heaven sent.  Cleo is the finest Mediterranean restaurant you'll find in all Las Vegas.  Katsuya sushi is my favorite from LA &amp; Hollywood.   I'm not too crazy about fast food so didn't try any of the fast food items! REMEMBER. This is not a 5 star hotel! It's a 4 star hotel and it's much smaller than places like the Wynn or Aria.  It's simple modern with a touch of luxury.  If your expectation is adjusted to reality, then you can enjoy it much more.  If you expect mandarin oriental type of service, then you're in the wrong place! #SLSLasVegas #LasVegas

      This place ruined my weekend. I came to Vegas to get married and was told by a friend how incredible this place is expected to be. So I looked it up and on their website, this place looks phenomenal!   I'm a firm believer in getting one chance to make a first impression and as soon as I park my car and unload, I realize the parking lot elevators are broken. As if carrying luggage down 4 flights isn't bad enough, we get to the check in counter and it literally took each front desk person an average of 20 minutes to check in each guest, us included. Finally, we get to the room and I will say the ambiance is nice, but the room sizes are tiny. Turning on the tv and it says it has a "server error" aka it doesn't work. I plan to ask the GM if we can cancel one of our nights so that we can relocate to the Venetian.   I probably should have done my due diligence and checked the yelp reviews before booking, but I guess I didn't expect many flaws from a brand new hotel.

      Not ready to be opened. We were invited to the grand opening and it was an amazing party--but it's just not ready to go live.   First off, this is not your typical Las Vegas casino--so if you're a traditionalist--you probably won't like this place. I definitely  think, however, that there is a niche market that was filled with the opening of SLS. Emphasis is not on gambling, but rather hospitality which is what SLS is known for.   Now, while first day openings are rarely smooth--our experience goes beyond first day glitches. We tried to check into our room. We waited over 1.5 hours and were still not given the room we were promised. Service in general is too laid back and relaxed; not very good (our checkin felt like we were in line at the DMV). The room we were given smelled like mildew (I don't even understand why) and attempted to call the first desk to be moved. We were on hold for 45 min and finally just went downstairs to deal with it in person. Also, the room we were given is much, much smaller than what we get at other casinos we patronize. Our casino host has been MIA, and claims she does not have great phone reception (tool of the trade if you're a host--lame excuse). We also attempted to change our restaurant reservations but had to wait until the evening when the restaurant opened because apparently, none of the systems are linked and it could not be accessed.   I wish this hotel and Casino great success, but I personally prefer the Wynn or Venetian--which are truly first class.

      Ridiculously Disappointed.    Went for opening day. I understood it was not going to be a top tier resort but was expecting something cool, sleek and trendy. Instead, the place looked cheap and almost bordered on ugly. I did not go into the rooms but did check out the place overall to see what they had in terms of restaurants and amenities.  I went to their buffet and it was ridiculously limited. It was opening day and opening weekend and there was little to celebrate there. Nothing lavish or interesting for Weekend Brunch. No salads or fresh veggies anywhere, no desserts, and no real options in terms of eats.  If they had 100 items (including the milk and butter) I would be shocked. The quality of some of their items was high and some of the food was tasty, but my overall impression of the place was not a good one.  They had three pizzas,   three different cold salmon options, crab legs, made to order omelets, sausages, bacon and other standard breakfast fare, a wide variety of dim sum offerings, a  few Chinese dishes, three pastas, a carving station, one Indian dish, three soups, twosushi rolls and one salmon sushi,  some fruit, a  pretty decent baked good section with overly dry donuts and excellent waffles and pancakes, a little yogurt and cereals and that was pretty much it.   There was nothing distinctive or special other than the lack of basics offered almost everywhere else. Instead of desserts, they had a few cookies and boring ice creams.  Instead of fresh salads or any greenery, they had nothing but one cooked broccoli dish.   Some of the food looked interesting but it was was hard to enjoy lukewarm food. The worst part of the buffet is that cold food was warm and hot food was cold. They did little to make the food appetizing when it had sat there cold for too long. We were there two hours and in that time, I think the cold pizza sat there the whole time with no one touching it.   Some of the food was tasty and would have been great if served hot. The coffee was pretty good. Waffles when fresh were good with a great batter. Bacon was nice quality.  Rather than use the tiny space  they had intelligently to offer small dishes of lot of interesting items, they use huge dishes to serve up enormous pans of very basic items like feta cheese that you can buy anywhere.    For one of the few stations they had available, they had sliced bread across a whole set up where they should have had desserts. A wall of sliced bread that you can buy anywhere is what they offered for $30 per person?! Not even interesting rolls but basic sliced bread. Ugh!  I had the distinct impression that there were very few items being cooked fresh by chefs and many more prep and serve ready made items by cooking staff.  This was opening week and they may not have yet had their act together, but unless they really change their approach, I think it will be a nice buffet for the folks who are staying at the hotel and nothing more.   I am writing this review with the hopes that for the locals who live close by and for the foodies who love Vegas bufffets, this can be a real destination buffet with an emphasis on more options and a real commitment to making sure food is served fresh and piping hot when its supposed to be hot.  They had promised a new concept in buffet dining, but there is nothing new about cold congealed food and basic offerings at premium prices.  I was very much looking forward to all the new restaurants. But after looking in on them, I think I may wait for reviews before trying them. In terms of space and furnishings, none of the new restaurants looked appealing to me.

      Worst club I've ever been in vegas. Cheesy and the speaker sucks. I just didn't know what to expect, it's so unorganized, I was in line forever, and we finally got in, there are so much going on but I just can't figure what they are trying to do. Weird and creepy. Atmosphere here is worst than down town............ Don't waste ur hard earned money

      Like other reviewers I too had high hopes for the SLS. Based on how long it took to renovate you would expect perfection. It looks nice, but seems to be cheap and missing elements of luxury. The problems began right off the bat. The elevators not working on opening day is a huge problem. Luckily I'm able to climb four flights of stairs, but many patrons aren't. Inside the casino the floors were dirty. It looked like there was hay from a farm animal? I saw two employees manning the players card area. The line for a new card was wrapped around the entrance and black jack tables making it difficult to make your way into the cramped casino. I played a few slots for about 45 minutes without seeing a single cocktail waitress. As I was leaving and thirsty I did see one waitress carrying a single beer on her tray. Any other casino on opening day would have waitresses out in full force feeding patrons booze and trying to get them to stay. I read in the Vegas Sun the SLS wants locals to come and play, but the first impression I was left with was not something I need to relive.

      Warning - Cockroaches!!! Read the whole review.   I too have NOT been impressed. Horrible first impression. After off loading our luggage and waiting 15 minutes for a bellman, we were then told that we were not at the hotel entrance for checking in and would have to walk through the casino to the opposite side to register. Not fun since I am coming off a broken ankle. We were then greeted at the entrance by something that looked like cola cola had been thrown around their white lit floors. GROSS! Something that could have easily been resolved with a quick mopping was instead left to give many visitors a horrible first impression.   We then transitioned to the casino floor carpet which also looked like this carpet was in bad need of replacement and had stain build-up over several decades. The carpet was so bad that I could not concentrate on anything else because of all the hair-balls and trash. Disgusting! I spent the next 30 minutes trying to figure out whether the stains were real or part of the design. The place was so dark that I believe they were trying to camouflage the horrible state the place was in.   I was expecting some sort of celebratory greeter or some form of grand opening celebration, there was absolutely none. Actually there was nothing to celebrate. Trying to find the registration desk was also impossible due to lack of signs and personnel to help guide you.  Once we found the registration we couldn't believe the disarray. No organization whatsoever. No lines and people just walking up to counters when people had been waiting for several minutes already. Once again dark like a dungeon. We gave some feedback and this was the start of the "we are working out the kinks" response. Wow, really? After staying one day of our three day stay our opinion has not changed.   As we went up to our rooms and stepping out of the elevators going to our room it was like being in a scene from a horror movie "The Grudge". See pic.   The rooms are tiny and we were told we got one of the better ones according to one of the bell staff. Really? Our room was interestingly designed. Don't know how to describe it but I've added some pics so you can make your own assessment. Kind of Ikea-ish to me.   Overall my assessment is that the owners tried to revive a building on the cheap and failed. Looks like they ran out of money when opening up and did not have enough employees when they most needed them at startup. I hope the best for this facility and hope they can work out the "kinks" and it works out for them. I appreciate the attempt, but I will likely not be coming back.  After a couple of nights here I still have not been impressed. Came in after night one and found a cockroach in my room near my food on the bar counter. I killed it and went down  to the front desk and showed them the picture and asked them to please clean up the cockroach. After returning later that evening I found the roach still in the exact same place. I went down again and spoke with the assistant manager and they sent someone of to clean it up. Ridiculous and absolutely unacceptable.  Gross! Horrible service as I was not asked for any compensation. I did not ask to be compensated because that's not how I roll. However, I would have expected something considering the circumstances. Worst experience ever.

      Very eclectic ambience, which made it feel like a miniature Cosmopolitan. The main difference is the monkeys all over the place. It was opening weekend, so it was packed. I love that it has monorail access and is extremely easy to get, which is great if you don't want to spend an arm and a leg taking a cab. I am a local, so curious to see how the traffic fluctuates in the coming months. I hope it does well and the north Strip renaissance continues with Resorts World, Rock at Rio and the proposed basketball arena in the works. They need to push the riff raff out of the area. If not, I have a feeling this place could attract a lot of the north side pimps and hoes.

      Overall mixed review...We are locals and were psyched to go see he new SLS. Unfortunately we were underwhelmed. It was hyped so much, but didn't deliver for us.  We stopped by two different bars and there were no specially drink menus (which is odd because the restaurants had great sounding drinks). At the Monkey Bar We ordered standard drinks--old fashioneds and cosmos. Service was slow (to be expected by the crowd) but the drinks were terrible. We left them on the table. The waitress apologized but there wasn't much she could do.  We ate at Cleo which was very good! The restaurant line up May be the best thing this place has going for it! The service was excellent and the food was great. We will definitely be back there...  The decor seems a little off and the carpet has got to go! It looked like it hadn't been cleaned post renovation...  Except for the restaurants, we won't be back....too many other good options south of SLS. Overall just blah.

      Ugh... That was a waste! Where do I start. 1. Parking garage elevators took too long. 2. Nothing special in there to make me want to come back. 3. $30 pp for the buffet for lunch? No wonder it was dead that's ridiculous. 4. They did have  "the griddle" but an hour wait. 5. The pool was cute, nothing to die for... then going back to the parking garage, the garage elevator didn't work again so I had to run up to the 5th floor and come back down to get my grandmother... Ughh just not impressed what so ever...

      I have mixed feelings about this place. Some good and some bad. Though I am impressed with how "different" SLS is from the old Sahara casino...some things should have been taken into consideration. For example: (Opening Day)  SPACE!!! The casino gaming area is too small and easily gets crowded and congested in my opinion. Imagine being inside a very busy packed night club, but with slot machines and game tables everywhere!!! Not pleasant. It felt like a bumper car ride at a carnival, trying to avoid getting bumped into!!!  BATHROOMS: Dirty and neglected!! Trash piled up high and falling over from the wall mounted trash cans!! Water splats all over the entire sink counter, and used up paper towels on the floor!! You could tell the bathroom had not been inspected for cleanliness or cleaned for most of the day!! I left the bathroom with a bad first impression. Geez...the 11 year old Emerald Casino in Henderson has waaaaay cleaner (spotless) bathrooms than the just opened SLS!!!   CARPET: What was up with those weird looking fur things that resembled rolled up, dried up hairballs a cat coughs up, all over the entire carpet?!! Not appealing to look at!!  HOTEL OPERATIONS: No excuses!! If you consider yourself a "luxury" resort...then your establishment needs to be on top of cleanliness!!! Dirty bathrooms, trash and filthy carpets are unapologetic, if you want to make and leave a good impression on your patrons!! (SLS-Style LUXURY Service)  CEILING: They went for the exposed (pipes, vents, wiring)  and open ceiling "industrial" look...baffling, since it really does not go well with the rest of the casino luxury theme. That exposed ceiling decor belongs more at a gym.  SAM STATUE: Hmmm...beauty is in the eye of  beholder I guess... :/  PARKING GARAGE: Non working elevators on opening day?!! Lucky for me, I got an immediate prime parking space right on the main floor &amp; did not need to use the elevator. Also, they had cones blocking the exit way to leave the garage when I left!! A valet guy had to move them cause they were meant for the entrance &amp; not the exit!!  What a shame and blown opportunity to become known as a huge hero!!! SLS could have made an impression that left the tourist and especially the locals saying: SLS...the resort that revived and saved the north end of The Strip for Las Vegas, NV!!!  I still believe this place has hope and potential...but not for long, if they don't make changes for the better and soon!! This place is a diamond in the rough that needs some SERIOUS polishing!!!!  Now for the good!! On food, drinks, service and shopping experience: (Reason for my 3 Stars)  UMAMI BURGER: Excellent, tasty, delicious food and great service!!! The place to eat, drink, gamble, watch &amp; bet on sports!! Great outdoor beer garden patio, facing the Vegas Strip. Our bartender by the name of Amber was not only sweet, friendly and great, she gave superb food &amp; drink recommendations: The Sahara Cooler, Truffle Fries and the Manly Burger-a cooked to order, juicy steak meat burger with bacon, melted cheddar and crispy batter fried onions on a warm buttered brioche bun...need I say more?? YUM!!!!!!!!!!   FRED SEGAL HOME: Small but well stocked unique boutique!! Distinctive concept and decor store. The Store Manager Eric was very helpful and gave excellent customer service and left us with a wonderful shopping experience!!   STAFF at SLS: Wow...talk about friendly customer service with a smile!!! Everyone we had to encounter from the bartenders, wait staff, security guard, Code card associates, parking attendants, gave excellent customer service!!! Helpful, friendly and very resourceful!!!   I am intrigued to come back and experience everything else SLS has to offer. One thing is for sure. This casino was not built to cater to the gambler, but to adjust to what is the "now" trend and the bread and butter of the  Vegas casinos; Shopping, Dinning and Night Life! Vital and needed to stay afloat!!   The Sahara casino floor was mainly used up to house 3 night clubs, and 8 restaurants, along with the Fred Segal stores that are spread out throughout the property. That is were all the gaming space from the former Sahara went.   If the food at Umami  Burger was phenomenal ...I can only imagine at 800, Cleo, Katzuya, The Griddle Cafe, Bazaar Meats,etc...  I did not stay or get to see the rooms at the hotel. (I live in Las Vegas)  I would love to come back and lounge at their pool. It looked very inviting.

      Can we say over hyped? Being a Las Vegas Local, may seem like I am being biased or sensitive on reviews, but just being at SLS will speak for it self. They spent so much money on advertising, hyping up the new resort by renovating a classic landmark casino in which was once called Sahara hotel.  Sadly with all the renovations or what has become, it sadly failed to deliver in giving honor to a classic Vegas time piece and destination.  Times have changed and obviously what goes up, must come down...but what gets rebuilt shouldn't always be the case.  This is what you get when you come to the SLS.   Owned by SBE entertainment and known for their posh boutique luxury style and offering...the SLS is anything but that.  In the capital city of entertainment destination around the world, the kind of grand opening that the SLS delivered was more of a 99 cents store opening up at a local ghetto. (With all due respect...I do shop at 99 cents store) but to get to the point of their grand opening is that, why open up shop when you are not ready?!?    Their carpets were all filled with wood and construction debris, the concrete pavement which was painted white were full of grease marks and over spray and was rather unpleasant. It reminded me of walking into  a model home being constructed.    Now the concept is nice and in some cases, some decor was actually modern and intriguing but it leaves you with a feeling of emptiness and questions yourself..."that's it?!?"  I'm not sure what the interior decorator or designer was going through but in my opinion and point of view, as if they were going for a mix of modern and vintage at the same time, rather than being contemporary.  There was too much going on yet too little of it going on. (Confusing right?...that's what it is confusing!)  We all know casinos don't have windows and clocks for a reason, but the ambience is pretty dark and gothic like. Lighting was a fail...common this is Vegas...not a Seattle grunge night club. It may be good for those who rock ED Hardy or are into twilight (no offense again I've watched the whole twilight series) but check out the ceilings. It looks like you are entering a consignment warehouse. Even with SLS being crowded due to grand opening, I managed to walk the whole casino floor premises in a boring 15 minutes.   SLS does offer some interesting restaurants and clubs but nothing on par with what MGM/WYNN offers in house.  Prices on some of the upscale restaurants are not worth paying (unless you have cash to blow and don't give a $&amp;@!) I'd rather take my business elsewhere.   And what's up with the parking lot/valet/taxi staging area/entrance? Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles could design a much better traffic flowing concept. This parking concept is literally an accident waiting to happen. My advice is be careful if you plan to visit and park. I suggest parking yourself instead if valet at least until they get their stuff together and that's if they do.    I really do hope SLS succeeds.  This is my city and I would hate failure to happen, but the way it is going now does not look good.  They need to step it up, otherwise they will lose customers, especially locals. Sahara Hotel was actually more better and even had a nascar cafe with roller coaster. I just hope this isn't the end of it, otherwise it will be the end of it. SLS until you can provide a cleaner, more attractive and on par resort...I won't be coming back anytime soon. For that matter, I may not come back at all.   1 star rating does not even do justice. If I could this rating would be negative.  So sad.

      Trying SO hard to be hip like The Cosmopolitan, ends up being more overdesigned like The Rumor boutique hotel.  Quirky details everwhere which are whimsical but not pulled together.  A Cleopatra picture here, an exposed bulb lighting fixture there, a wood table here -  It just ends up being wierd. Their logo is 3 drunken monkeys on a chandelier.  Yep that about sums it up- drunken monkeys stealing mirrors and forks - stressful.    Very chaotic.  Very tightly packed casino floor with restraunts and clubs lining the outside - tons of murals and graffiti walls.  The ugliest casino carpet I have ever seen with writing that I can't make out what it says.  I ate at Umami burger.  Had the vegetarian sloppy Joe, shoestring fries and a soda water -good but $25!  Was excited for a hotel opening but will not be back.  They only want the CA kids it seems.  The pool looked nice.  Maybe I would come back for that one day.

      The SLS Hotel and Casino had a lot of hype surrounding it so I was eager to give it a visit on my trip to Vegas. Now I know what the SLS stands for - Shitty Lame Sucky.  I anticipated that it would be overcrowded and the staff overwhelmed, so that part did not bother me. But some other things...  How do you have all your elevators in your parking structure konk out simultaneously? Going up 6 flights of stairs in stifling Vegas heat is no one's idea of a picnic. I felt so bad for some of the disabled patrons that were huffing and cussing as they were climbing up the stairs. Couldn't they have at least provided a cart that would transport them to their car? The ADA is going to have a field day with this one.  The whole vibe they are going for is Industrial Chic.  You can see all of the air-conditioning ducting as it is just painted black. There is also a wall in the hotel that has graffiti all over it.  It looks like they couldn't decide what style they were going for so they just incorporated a bunch of them. Sure the place is easy to navigate...their gaming area is smaller than most Indian Casinos. I especially loved all of the broken bottles and vomit in the parking structure just left there from the night before. The carpet was shedding worse than a Persian cat.  There were so many fuzzballs all over the place, I thought someone's dryer trap exploded all over the casino floor.  The saving grace for the SLS is that it has some great restaurants - Katsuya, Bazaar Meat by Jose Andres, Umami, 800 Degrees, and Ku Noodle to name a few.  But time will tell if the establishment continues to wow or just mires itself in mediocrity due to its lack of attention to detail.

      It's not often that a new hotel and casino opens up in Las Vegas, especially one that's transplanting some of LA's most well-known restaurants. With the food and all the hype surrounding the SLS, I've been pretty excited for the place to open! So much so, that we decided to book a room and stay here on opening night. For a 325 square foot room with a single king bed in the "Story Tower", our rate was $209 per night and we stayed just 1 night.  When we first arrived at about 6pm, we made our way to the parking garage that you enter from Paradise. And although we were trying to check in, we weren't allowed to valet or pull up to the front for unloading, as were told they were just too full and busy. After finally finding a spot in the garage, we were faced with broken elevators and had to carry our bags down 5 flights of stairs. Thankfully we just had 1 bag with enough for 1 night, so it wasn't a huge deal, but it was frustrating and not the best first impression. When we got to check-in, they were well aware of the elevator issues and offered us a couple free drinks at the Monkey Bar, which is just across the way. The check-in by the way, was pretty straight forward, quick and painless.  For the rooms, they offer several different types and there's 3 towers...the World Tower, the Lux Tower and the Story Tower, which is where we stayed. The room itself was a bit on the small side, but it was quite impressive. When you walk in, your attention is immediately drawn to the opaque white bed and couch that have dimmable lights build right into them! There's also a 55" TV hanging from the wall and a giant mirror on the ceiling above the bed that might catch your attention. The styling is very modern with a darker grey paint, and yellow accents underneath a strange industrial concrete style ceiling. Both the bathroom and shower, which are separated, also feature bright yellow tiles, and are hidden behind two large sliding mirrors. For the size of the room, I was pretty impressed with the layout and use of space. And although expensive, the mini bar was nicely stocked. We did have issues with some lights and the TV not working in the room, but that easy to look past. Overall though, I can't say I'd recommend paying $200 a night here...actually about $260 after all taxes, fees, etc.  When it comes to the casino itself, their main focal point seems to be restaurants and nightlife. In my opinion, these are super solid restaurant choices and worth the visit alone. However, if you aren't a partier, you might find yourself bored here. Compared to other casinos, the machines and tables seem to be limited and they are all very close together. There's also minimal shopping choices and apart from a coffee shop, I was surprised to see that they didn't include any type of dedicated dessert/treat spot here. For the most part though, I thought the overall style of the place was alright. But some things were strange and seemed out of place, like the open industrial ceiling, and the buffet which is upstairs and completely separate from just about everything. By the way, the Sunday breakfast/lunch buffet was $31, and the dinner $37...ouch!  My feelings on the employees are very mixed. As many people have mentioned, the amount of employees standing around and doing nothing but talking was a bit ridiculous. I can understaff overstaffing for grand opening, but on several occasions we saw 3+ employees in a group just kind of standing around and chatting. We also had our fair share of issues during our stay, and our interaction with the staff was a bit hit and miss. Since this was the first day, I won't get too far into all our issues but we had to visit the desk 3 times and speak with 3 different managers due to room problems and huge bill discrepancies. On Saturday night, we spent an hour dealing with a $140 charge for two drinks at the Monkey bar. Then on Sunday, it took us over an hour just to check out because our bill was beyond messed up, to the tune of over $200. However, Aubrey who checked us out was extremely nice, patient and seemed genuinely apologetic about the mess we had on our hands. She was the reason I decided to bump this review up to 3 stars, instead of 2.   With SBE behind the place, I really thought they would have a lot smoother launch. I mean, you obviously can't expect a flawless experience on opening weekend, but I was a bit surprised to see just how many issues they had. I was also disappointed with some of the pricing they have set up. Bottled beers at the center bar are $8 each and a Gatorade at The Perq coffee shop was $5! Yes, it's a casino but c'mon. And why are there no locals specials for anything?  All in all, we had a great time and the restaurants will surely keep me a regular at SLS. However, it was a bit overhyped and unless they bring out some killer room rates, this wouldn't be my choice for another staycation.

      SLS was a huge disappointment for us this weekend. We were there at the midnight opening on Friday, and then we came back again today to eat at the Griddle Cafe. Two words best described our experience...filthy and overrated. We expected chaos and crowds, however, we did not expect dirty interior floors, trashed sidewalks, and thousands of cigarette butts laying in the landscape all weekend long. We feel like there must not have been an adequate cleaning staff, and obviously there was a serious shedding problem of the flooring. There were even employees standing right by mounds of trash who never picked it up. We said "no" to dining there today. We refused to give them our business due to their lack of cleanliness throughout the interior and exterior. We have no reason to go back there at this time, and we certainly wouldn't suggest our guests and friends to visit there either.

      I'm so surprised to see how many bad reviews about this hotel and I'm not sure if it has to do with being a local or not. I moved here from LA in January, so as a local now, I find this hotel beautiful and exciting! Whether or not being a local has anything to do with it, doesn't matter. It's beautiful and trendy and very modern. The outside is as gorgeous as the inside and their LED everything makes it very eye-catching.  We are eating a Umami and the burgers are so incredibly good, just like in LA. We haven't had one since we moved and have been looking forward to this since the announcement that it would be here.  Just come in and see it for yourself! I know this hotel will work out it's kinks (like every new place) and it will be the hottest thing on the strip.

      I've been anticipating SLS opening their doors and now I'm sadly disappointed.   Staff: The dealers at the tables were very friendly and welcoming. I agree with other reviewers that there are way too many employees standing around doing nothing but chatting with one another. We walked around and saw groups of 3 or more employees just leaning against the wall talking. Other than the dealers no other staff member said hello or went out of their way to acknowledge guests and seemed engrossed in their own conversations.   Cleanliness: The amount of trash and dirt was astounding. The carpets were covered with cigarette ash and bits of junk. Either they don't have enough people cleaning or they don't seem to care to clean up. Maybe the staff that just stand around talking could take pride in their own establishment and pitch in. There were half empty glasses left out in the bars from the night before. Walking around and seeing that the bars left dirty things overnight was such a turnoff. The bathrooms had toilet paper strewn about all over the floor and the trash was piled high in the baskets. Plus the janitorial staff left piles of plastic bags of trash outside the bathroom entrance.   The Griddle: We went here for breakfast and had to wait over 15 minutes to be seated when 2/3 of tables were empty. The line of people outside couldn't stop complaining about how poorly the 4 (yes, 4) hostesses were handling the seating. When asked about the hold-up their response was that the staff was going through a shift change.    After being seated it took a few minutes before anyone came by with water. Then, it took a few more minutes before our server came by. Another server brought someone else's food to our table and then my boyfriend's meal was brought first and it took over 5 more minutes for my food to come out. When we finished our meal about an hour later and walked out of the restaurant at about 9am the line to get in went around the corner and the staff must still have been going through a shift change because there were loads of empty tables inside.   Spa: We wanted to check out the spa but an unfriendly guard brusquely told us that only guests can go to the spa. I don't know how the spa will do if their only clientele comes from the hotel. You would think that they would want more business. All the other spas on the strip welcome outside guests.   I noticed that a lot of people who left positive reviews had specifically attended the grand opening party. I would imagine that in the hype of the event everything seemed great but during the day and to an average visitor this place is just a huge flop. Disappointing.
