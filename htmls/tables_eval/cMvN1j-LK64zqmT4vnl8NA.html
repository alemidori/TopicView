      I was intrigued by the idea of Chinese/Mexican fusion but unfortunately in a combination of poor service and incomplete menu descriptions, my visit was less than stellar.  We ordered the $12 guac which was pretty much like guac anywhere they make it fresh, so the price was a bit crazy.  The house-made tortillas were fine, but not mouthwatering buttery softness like when I make them which is weird cause I just use Maseca...  The shrimp mojo was the best item we ordered though I thought the shrimp had a very strong aftertaste.  The combo of sweet garlic, poblano, and onion was good though  The spring rolls were fried so in my world that would be an eggroll. Either way the veggie mixture inside was less than average in taste.  The flavor is indescribable except that I would not ever order them again.  The refried beans with cheese and crema (less than a spoonful) came out looking like a turd on a plate.  Even the waiter laughed when we looked  at it.  They were not worth 7 bucks but it was average.  And finally the Glass noodle dish.  I ordered it to be my main course.  It was cold, which was nowhere in the description, which was a disappointment to me because the restaurant itself was freaking Antarctica.  Besides the initial disappointment, the flavor was not great, salty and over-bearing sauce drowned the veggies.   The portions are very small as well.  The waiters kept bringing food to our table that wasn't ours and then looking at us like we were crazy when we explained we didn't order anything like that (mostly it was tacos and later a soup\...wtf?)  Also the food came out like sushi, one plate at a time in completely random order. It was weird. I usually do not take stars away for service, but in this case the service was so disorganized and bizarre, I felt I must.

      We were very impressed with China Poblano. To start with, you might like to read this informative story about the ideas behind the place: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/dining/13andres.html The decor is very intriguing, with design coming from SEED. The hybridity of Mexico and China is reflected in the interesting visuals--Mao next to Frida Kahlo and other variations. The entrance includes a fast-food looking window (Chinese Food), complete with noodle bar, and a second fast-food window (Mexican Food) with a tortilla bar. The visual design elements heighten the diner's sense that something hybrid is at play here. We really enjoyed our server who was very informative about the choices. We sampled the Love Is in the Air (a molecular gastronomic take on an heirloom tomato salad). We found the play between salty and sweet to be incredible. The sugar foam is very interesting and I found my taste buds unable to determine, at any one moment, whether it was salty or sweet. The Beijing Glass was perhaps the best noodle dish that we have had. It was outstanding in every respect. Dancing Eggplant is a visual dish that includes bonito flakes that move up and down due to the steam rising from the cooked eggplant. Again, an outstanding dish with perfectly cooked eggplant and a delicious sauce. The only down side was the taco (Chicen Mole). As other reviewers have offered, there is nothing to write home about in terms of the tortillas. They don't seem to replicate street food quality. The chicken was tender, but not the best mole. Perhaps they can work out those kinks. Overall, you shouldn't miss this place. The experience and food is intriguing. Jose Andres is a true genius and artist.

      2.5 stars  Unfortunately, I was ultimately disappointed.  The service was actually quite excellent, but the food ultimately fell short, considering the price.    It was interesting to see that in the front of house, there were two kitchens.  A Mexican kitchen and a Chinese kitchen on opposite ends.  I was hoping for more fusion entr√©es, but there were only a few.  The menu was predominantly Mexican or Chinese.    Setas Tacos: Mushroom tacos.  Nothing special.  It felt it needed some kind of fresh vegetable in there to add some crunch.  Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice: Actually pretty good with an amazing variety of vegetables in it.  Good flavors, season well.  Is it worth paying $16 for fried rice...however good it may be?  Questionable.  The Unruly Monk: Hand-cut noodle soup.  When it came out, it smelled absolutely amazing and then it went downhill from there.  The hand-cut noodles were overcooked and mushy.  The broth lacked flavor.  Beijing Glass: My friend had this one.  It actually had a nice crunch and was refreshing.  I'd call this dish a success.  Guacamole: This was really good guacamole with just a hint of heat.  But $12 for only one cup of guac????  C'mon...that's crazy talk.   Papas Fritas with XO Sauce: Interesting concept, but WOW...that XO sauce is extremely overpowering and extremely greasy.  I had about 4 fries, but after that, it was too much.  Happy Buddha Giggling Taking a Bath: It seemed like a pretty fun dessert.  How can you not like a jello mold of Buddha sitting in lychee foam??  It was fun to squeeze his cheeks to make his mouth move, but it was pure novelty and not worth the $10.   All-in-all, it was some hits, but more misses.  Great service kinda made up for it.

      I was super excited to have been able to get dinner reservations at China Poblano on its opening day.  Having grown up eating a lot of Chinese and Mexican food, I was excited about this fusion of such different cuisines.  Furthermore, I had high expectations for a restaurant of Chef Jose Andres.  Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed by my experience at this new casual dining restaurant.  First, service was not up to par.  Despite our 7 o'clock reservations, we had to wait about 45 minutes to get seated.  We were comped guacamole and chips for the long wait, which was a nice gesture.  Servers kept bringing us dishes which were meant for other tables, which became annoying after the third time.    Second, the food was just okay.  The menu is split up between Mexican cuisine and Chinese cuisine, with a few fushion dishes.  I thought the whole menu would consist of fusion dishes. We ordered a variety of dishes from both sections of the menu -- nothing really stood out as being delicious.  The al pastor taco was good.  The fries with mole was interesting. The hot and sour soup was salty.  The dishes are all very small, tapas style and they bring out everything as it is ready.   For dessert we ordered the chocolate warrior and giggling buddha.  Both looked interesting but neither tasted good.   As for decor and ambiance ... the restuarant is casual, the atmosphere is fun.  The decor is kinda tacky looking.  With all of its bright colors and funky decorations, it kind of reminded me of Pink Tacos.  All in all, I love the concept and the history behind the fusion of Mexican and Chinese food. I also feel like the China Poblano has a lot of potential.  However, it definitely has a lot of kinks it needs to work out before it can be a big hit.

      We had a great Christmas lunch here.   Overall the food was good, but nothing to rave about. It takes some time to get used to having Chinese and Mexican at the same time. I recommend the rou jia mo street sandwich, shrimp mojo, and lamb potstickers. Papas frites (fries) were excellent as well, but I would order it with the toppings on the side. Just don't get the 20 vegetable fried rice...it was boring, the portion was tiny, and definitely not worth $16.88!  The main reason I'm giving it 5 stars is the desserts. They were amazing! we had mango sticky rice, happy buddha gello, and coconut tapioca balls. They were all delicious without being too sweet.   I also loved the interior with funky mix of Mexican and Chinese decorations.

      If you don't want buffets in Vegas but you still want a meal that would fill you up, China Poblano is not a place for you. Basically the portions were extremely small considering the prices you had to pay. The most disappointing dish we had was the Mongolian beef dish. We thought we were going to have a full meat dish. It ended up looking like a salad dish with more lettuce than meat in it, and the meat were in extremely small sizes. I also saw the face of our neighbor's when he got the same dish. He was shocked just as we were when he received the dish. I thought Chinese and Mexican food usually serve big portions. Not here. It's definitely not worth your money for a middle class family. I was still hungry after the meal. This is an embarrassment for such a beautiful hotel that just opened for a week...I felt kind of cheated eating here. Instead, I recommend to take your money to the Cosmo. buffet.

      This place sounded awesome: half mexican food half chinese.   They also have a noodle show where you see  some guy pull a piece of dough into noodles.   According to everything, hand pulled noodles are supposed to have excellent texture compared to machine made noodles and should be awesome. So i was super excited about the idea that maybe i won't have to fly to china to enjoy hand pulled noodle anymore.   Well I should've taken it as a bad sign when I asked the waitress for the dish with the hand pulled noodles and she looked at me like it was the first time she's heard of it.  She tells me the Unruly Monk dish should be the one that has it.   Next I also ordered a beef tongue taco.  As I waited for the food I watched the chef pull the noodles and then another bad sign. I realized he never once successfully finish pulling the noodles. Half way he would quit cause he messed up. For my entire meal he "finished" making noodles twice but he never brought them to the kitchen. They just sat there. Which made me wonder if the noodle show was just a show.  When the food arrived I was very sad. For 16 dollars you get the saddest amount of super soggy noodles. The texture would be described as noodles left in broth overnight.   The tacos were okay but you can totally have better ones in  downtown LA and at a wayyy better price. 9$ for two mini tacos?! that taste average?!   SAD SAD SAD whether or not the noodles were pulled in restaurant or not it was an all around disappointing meal.

      Intrigued by the idea of a Chinese/Mexican restaurant. Since it's not actually fusion because there are separate Mex and Chinese items, you would think that they'd be masters of both Chinese and Mexican cuisine. However,  not one thing on the menu was interesting or tasty. The broth in my wonton and noodle soup was absolutely tasteless - I prefer the Sapporo Ichiban that I make for myself at home!  Don't bother with this place. It's trendy but tasteless.

      We were checking out Cosmopolitan and accidentaly came across this restaurant. When I looked at the menu I thought it was way overpriced, but then I realized I was in the brand new 5 star Las Vegas strip hotel, so it was OK. All restaurants in LV strip hotel are overpriced anyway. Expect to order at least two dishes per person (around $30) because the portion is really small.   We had: - Guacamole Really good but a bit salty. The tortillas are super good, the best I have   tasted so far.     - Twenty veg fried rice The best fried rice I have ever tasted, rice is cooked perfectly and the vegetables are super fresh. (I am Chinese, so I know my fried rice) - When pigs fly (steamed pork buns, dimsum style) So so. They used the really fatty part of the pork, so I can't really taste the meat when I bite into it. - Chicken JiSong  It was OK, good, but not impressed. - Unruly monk (vegetable noodle soup) Really good noodles, perfectly al dente. The soup is OK.  So among the food I ordered I was most impressed by the fried rice. The portion was super small for $16, but it was good.  Will visit this place again on another trip to Vegas.

      Great concept, but way overpriced, tiny portions, and meh flavor.  I ordered 3 dishes with my friends (glass noodles, tuna cerviche, tacos) and were shocked by how small the dishes were.  We would have needed to order 15 items to get even 1/4 full.  The dishes were expensive too.  Each one was $10-$15, and drinks are also pricey.  My 8oz. diet coke was $5!  8oz is smaller than a can!  Our tiny snack ended up costing $65.    This place is supposed to be chinese/mexican fusion, but we couldn't taste the fusion.  It seems like they just add avocado to any chinese dish and call it chinese mexican fusion.  We were really disappointed.  Skip.

      A total disappointment.  Food was bland and small.  expect to need at least 3 dishes per person for a minimum of $30/person for an eh meal.  The concept was a good idea, but backless chairs, very small tapas style cuisine, and mediocre food I would skip.

      The first thing that went wrong was on the wall. At first, I liked the decor --a casual, colorful blend of Chinese and Mexican motifs --Chinese opera masks, Oaxacan wood carvings, red glass lanterns, bicycle wheels on the ceiling (not sure the country, but cool). They also had portraits that were actually large projections, that switched every few minutes. So you had Frida Kahlo, the Dalai Lama (not Chinese, by the way!) and random peasants.  What pissed me off before our food even came out was that they were projecting a photo of Mao. If you were running a German restaurant, would you put up a picture of Hitler? Because that's basically who Mao was in China. I know it's considered hip and trendy to use Mao's image as a cultural icon, but THIS MUST STOP.   Okay, on to the food. The next thing that went wrong was they brought out the wrong order --we'd ordered duck tongue tacos, they brought the beef tendon with kumamoto oyster. My husband took a bite and realized the mistake --and also that the oyster was really off. I could smell it across the table, and no way should a fresh oyster smell that strong. Kumamotos are my favorite oyster so I am very familiar with a fresh, sweet specimen. This was wrong.   Our server was very friendly and seemed sharp, she took it away with an apology and we got the duck tongue. I took a bite and it was pretty tasty. However, I couldn't get over the fact that I was chewing on a tongue, and tender and flavorful as it was, I couldn't take another bite.   However, the salsa that came with the tacos was DELICOUS. I was eating it with a spoon (since I didn't want any more tongue). One of the best salsas I've had, it ranks up there with Papalote's in SF and Cancun's in Berkeley. Really amazing.   The Beijing glass was fresh and healthy --a big mixture of chilled glass noodles and veggies. It was underdressed, however, and finally we asked for extra dressing which helped a lot.   The gazpacho was a big surprise --we expected the traditional soup presentation, but instead, got a bowl of cut fruit, and a server squeezed orange over it, tableside. It was delicious, with jicama and dragonfruit in the mix.   We also ordered the scallop ceviche at the recommendation of our server and this was a HUGE disappointment. For the price (about $12, I think) we got 4 bay scallops (tiny). The concept was cool --they were served on top of limes that had chiles and sugar on top. You popped the scallop and followed with a squeeze of sugary, spicy lime juice. It just underwhelmed because the scallops were so diminutive and less than stellar. For that price and with that presentation, you expect stellar and full-sized diver freshness.   The dessert we got was great --Tres Lychees (a play on tres leches cake). The lychees came three ways --in a milk-soaked cake, whole, on top of the cake, and as a foam.   Our whole lunch bill came to about $75, and I was still a little hungry afterwards. If you go, I recommend being extremely judicious with your ordering, read reviews to see what's good, and maybe stash a snack in your purse.  Some people have complained that there isn't enough "fusion" on the menu --but most of the dishes (even if they're listed as "Mexican" or "Chinese" only) have a twist. We discovered that the twists are not necessarily explained on the menu, and you may get some big surprises (like our gazpacho). So I appreciate what the restaurant is trying to do --blend two disparate traditions in a delicious way, surprise with ingredients, and use molecular techniques when it enhances the food.

      Conceptually "Chinese Mexican fusion," China Poblano is billed as a blending of the two rich cultures.  Located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan somewhat hidden in the back, the restaurant is certainly eye catching.  With an entryway shaped like Buddha and "Mexican Takeout" windows on either side the campy feel is palpable, but acceptable.  With an interior of communal and separate dining tables, a noodle making station, and wall decorations ranging from Chinese Opera Masks and Lanterns to Luchador Masks and Oaxacan carvings the interior was colorful to say the least.  In addition to the fixed objects there were also large morphing murals - projections of famous and peasant Chinese and Mexican individuals.  To see the restaurant is to love it-or perhaps to hate it-it is certainly over the top.  Arriving in warm soft shells and approximately three bites each the first tastes of taco would come from Langosta.  Described as meaty lobster/mango/arbol chile sauce ($16 for 2 now, $6/e prev) the flavors were good, but unfortunately the lobster was slightly overcooked and I felt the chile sauce overwhelmed the subtleties of the sweet crustacean.  Silencio tacos - duck tongue/rambutan fruit ($4.5/e.)  Unfamiliar with rambutan until this time I was impressed by the fleshy sweet fruit and its ability to temper the salty, savory, and somewhat chewy tongues.  While not as nuanced as some of the other tacos, these are definitely worth checking out if only to experience the ingredients at a relatively cheap price.  The Cochinita tacos, described as Yucatan-style pit barbeque pork/marinated onions ($4/e) were good, but rather expected and unidimensional.   Savory and sweet the pork and onions melded nicely, but in total the flavor was no better or worse than a good pork taco anywhere else.  Carnitas braised baby pig/pork rinds/spicy salsa verde cruda ($4/e prev.)  With the braised baby pig perfectly done-supple, moist and flavorful-the addition of pork rinds added a lovely degree of crunch and saltiness.  Tempering the other two dishes and adding a bit of spice plus vegetal acidity the salsa was spicy without being overly so-in my opinion they should serve this salsa instead of the chipotle version with the tortilla chips.  Coctel de Camarones fresh shrimp/jumbo lump crab meat/tomato/avocado ($12.)  Essentially a whole lot of underwhelming salsa in a bowl with a couple of snappy sweet shrimp, thin shreds of crab, and chunks of avocado plus tortillas for dunking it was almost as if someone forgot to add salt, or spice, or vinegar, or really anything other than the listed ingredients which simply were not of all that impressive quality.  Love Is In the Air heirloom tomatoes/sugar air ($8.88) was much simpler in ingredients and much more complex in flavor.  Nicely presented in a large bowl with what must have been two fresh whole tomatoes and a splash of vinegar the dish was topped with an "mg" manufactured foam full of delicate sweetness that acted only to enhance the natural flavors of the tomatoes beneath.  Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You vegetables/crispy lace ($11.88 now, $8.88 at our visit) delivered five pockets of lamb, cabbage, radish, and smoky seasonings inside a crispy lace shell.  While slightly oily, the lamb itself was impressively cooked and not a bit gamey-with the m√©lange of vegetables elevated by the cumin and black pepper this dish was clever and tasty with obvious contributions from both Hispanic and Chinese cultures.  Ocean Nest scallops/crab/shrimp/pan-fried egg noodles/seasonal vegetables ($10 at our visit and now $22 w/ king crab/lobster) would be a successful yet rather ordinary dish.  With crispy noodles resting in a gentle fish broth at the base and three head-on shrimp, three scallops, and a few chunks of crab interspersed with bok choy, spinach, and onions the flavors all worked and the textures were nicely done-at $10 the dish was a steal, but lobster or not I don't think I'd recommend it at the current price point unless there was a good deal more seafood.  The Unruly Monk with hand-cut noodles/bok choy/wild wood ear mushrooms/poached egg ($16) was served in an enormous bowl with perhaps a half liter of broth, boiled bok choy, a single egg, and a plethora of mushrooms the dish would be a nearly mirror experience of the Ocean Nest-a nicely executed dish, but no better than could be made at a local Chinese restaurant in most mid-sized US cities.  In the end I think the verdict is still out on China Poblano - I'm not willing to rule it out, but I'm also not ready to say the "concept" (which is exactly what it is) "works."  While certain dishes worked to great effect, others merely represented decent versions of Americanized ethnic food, and some were simply underwhelming.  Looking at the menu only 2 weeks after my visit I already see many changes and given Andres' propensity for exploration I've no doubt the menu will continue to evolve as they find what works and doesn't.

      I love Oyamel and Jaleo, so I was eager to see Jose Andres' latest creation, and I had really high expectations for China Poblano.  I had this idea that Mexican-Chinese fusion would be the love child of two of my favorite restaurants, Oyamel and Myers+Chang (a funky pan-Asian restaurant in Boston).  We decided to try the Asian side of the menu at China Poblano, after we realized that there weren't that many fusion dishes on the menu.  The good: the tuna ceviche was great - the soy sauce did NOT make me think of sashimi at all! overall, it was a flavor combination that I wouldn't have thought of, and I liked the texture of the ceviche with the walnuts.  The monk's noodles had a nice texture, and I was pleasantly surprised by the fried rice - it really distinguished itself from your average fried rice.  As far as drinks go, I had a margarita with sea salt "foam" (standard at Oyamel, still tasty here).  The lemon drop with "noodles" was clever, and it tasted like your standard lemon drop.  Yes, I bought into the cutesy presentation, and I enjoyed it.  Also good: the service.  The host table seemed a bit confused but once we were seated, everyone was great.  Our waitress had recommended the tuna ceviche to us over the scallop ceviche, since she thought the scallop portion was too small, and I always like candor from the waitstaff.  There was also a mistake at the bar, and when she saw a drink about to go to waste she brought it over to me (yay!)  The entire staff was very attentive.  The bad: we had the "when pigs fly" pork steam buns, and something about the texture of the bao was off.  Even worse though, the meat was underseasoned.  The same thing goes for the ten treasure noodle soup and the monk's noodles - they looked great but the broth was underwhelming.  It's difficult to get the broth just right (Tampopo, anyone?) but if you can't, maybe you shouldn't offer so many noodle soups on your menu.  I'm willing to give China Poblano the benefit of the doubt, as the restaurant was only two weeks old when we visited.  I will probably eat here again... but there are so many restaurants to try on the strip, so I'm not sure when or if I'll be back.  The bottom line is, Jose Andres does a fantastic job with Mexican cuisine and tapas, so if you're going to visit, maybe that's what you should stick with.  My visit to China Poblano just left me craving a visit to Myers+Chang and Oyamel.  I didn't take the ceviche and tacos at Oyamel for granted before, but I will certainly appreciate them a lot more on my next visit.

      I lived in DC for a while, so I am a frequent visitor to Jose Andres' restaurants and an avid fan.  I was really excited to try his new restaurant in Vegas, and it did not disappoint!  I came here with a group of 4 people, and we ordered 11 dishes I believe + 2 desserts.  They have a few chefs working at the front of the restaurant so people walking by can watch them make handmade tortillas and hand pulled noodles.  They also have two take out windows with a smaller menu that you can order from.  The decor is modern with Chinese and Mexican elements and made me think of something I would see in an Urban Outfitters catalog or on display at the MoMA.  The guacamole and hand made tortillas were to die for!  I could have just eaten guacamole for dinner.  And they have the best tortillas I've ever had.  My favorite presentation was the scallop ceviche, which they place on a carmelized key lime.  They lightly spray vodka on it, you eat the scallop, and then squeeze the lime into your mouth.  Almost like taking a tequila shot.  I also thought the hand pulled noodles were amazing and cooked to perfection.  We ordered the Unruly Monk soup, and it was very light and refreshing, but at the same time, full of vegetables.  I would probably come here for lunch and order just that and maybe a small side dish.  We also ordered another soup, Caldo Tlalpeno, which I thought was more fusion, and I also enjoyed that soup as well.  We ordered the Nice, but Naughty dish with lotus root and pea shoots which doesn't taste very Chinese because the pea shoots were somewhat raw but I enjoyed it nonetheless.  I also enjoyed the Chicken Ji Song and liked the presentation of it, especially with the fried sweet potato on top.  We tried a bunch of different tacos, and I think flavorwise, I liked the beef tendon and it was melt in your mouth tender, but also the greasiest taco out of all of them.  We didn't end up order any dim sum because I knew I could probably eat tastier (and cheaper) dim sum in Chinatown.  We ordered the flan and the happy buddha giggling taking a bath.  The flan is deliciously creamy and easily one of the best flans I've ever had.  The happy buddha is really cute and he really is taking a bath!  It's one of the most entertaining desserts I've ever had.  It isn't your normal jello.  They make it from scratch with fresh strawberries and use seaweed extract instead of gelatin, and it has a very smooth flavor.  It's very refreshing at the end of a huge meal.  The dishes aren't that expensive but they do add up very quickly, and we ended up spending more than I wanted to, but it was definitely a fun and enjoyable experience, not to mention yummy!

      Such an interesting concept in a gorgeous new casino on the strip!   What initially caught my eye were the neon signs on either side of the entrance. One proclaiming "Mexican Food" and the other "Chinese Food". Being a Mexican food junkie, my friend and I saddled up the bar on the Mexican side of the restaurant surrounded by cool Lucha Libre masks. We watched the Mexican women make fresh corn tortillas by hand behind the bar.   I started with my token order of chips, salsa and guac. Oh..my..God!! The chips were to die for (What is that seasoning?), the salsa had a nice spicy kick and the $12 bowl of guacamole was huge &amp; fresh!  We then split an order of chicken tacos which are small and come ala carte. The corn tortillas were as delicious as they looked! Naturally, I washed it all down with their signature salt margarita which had an amazing lime tasting foam on top.  I can't vouch for the Chinese side of this joint but the whole restaurant was buzzing with energy and I am still dreaming about the food a week later....

      I don't understand how this place is getting such good reviews. It didn't do Chinese OR Mexican food well.  dan dan noodles - super small portion of noodles for $12... our table of 5 basically got one bite each  mongolian beef and lettuce - when it came out, i thought it was a salad, there was so much lettuce and the beef was M&amp;M-sized and thus lost in all the lettuce  tacos - got two orders of this, and it tasted fine, but when the two tacos were SO tiny, they were like two bites each.  buns - this was fine, not the best, but relative to everything else it was okay.  Basically it was disappointing. Please don't eat here.

      Food is amazing!!!! Like every food item we ordered melted in my mouth.   not a fan of the table layout - all the tables are very small and only 1 ft away from the next table...so if you get stuck to someone annoying they will become a part of your meal...not cool  portion sizes are tiny - so you wind up ordering 3ish items per person which is ok but doesn't work well when you have such a small table

      With the mix of good and bad reviews I thought that we should give this place the benefit of the doubt as it is very visually appealing. I was totally wrong - it really is that bad. The decor and service were all fine but the food was terrible and a real struggle to finish (I hate leaving food). The Queso Fundido was the last dish to arrive; fortunately it was a minuscule portion as it was so rubbery and unappetizing. One to avoid.

      The concept is fancy but the flavor, lacking.  Ordered quite a few dishes here to share between 3 people, but nothing stood out that made me want to try again next time I'm in town. The best of the dishes were on the Mexican side of the menu...all the different tacos are average to above average.  Noodles - you automatically want to try the hand pulled noodles right away because theres always fresh noodles being pulled by the chef in the front of the restaurant. However, the dan dan noodles we tried was soggy, no texture and over cooked. ARgh, what a disappointment.  Buns - tasted like it was reheated from the frozen varieties.  Is it too harsh to say the next best thing to order was the Mexican Coke !!?!

      AMAZING!! And oh my GOSH, how soon can I go back? Everything we ordered was amazing. (And its pretty wierd at first to have Mexican and Asian on the same table, but everything was so tasty, you get over it quickly).   Dan Dan Mian was super-wow. Please double the modest serving, ChinaPoblano! The hearts-of-palm salad was totally unique (long shreds) - yummy. All the tacos were out-of-this-world flavorful. Waiter suggested the short rib tacos - oh yeah. You'll want a lot of those (mouth is watering) [sluurp] oh, excuse me. The quality of the fresh noodles will ruin you for any other Asian noodle situation where they don't use homemade fresh noodles. Five stars, and happily so.

      Where else can you dine under the watchful gaze of Mao Zedong? It's ironic that his image is used in a restaurant since under his... um... leadership... millions starved due to his wackadoodle policies. And, let's not even mention the whole torture and death thing.  But, I digress. My wife and I stopped by China (pronounced "chee na") Poblano after already eating dinner a couple hours earlier. So we only got 2 things. Now, on to the food...  Langosta tacos ($16) - lobster, salsa Mexicana, arbol chile sauce. 2 per order. The lobster was a little tough and the tortilla was too small compared to the amount of filling. The tortilla was also too fragile -- it tore apart as I picked it up to take a bite. They should have doubled up the tortillas for each taco like typical street tacos.  Coctel de camarones ($12) - fresh shrimp, jumbo lump crab meat, tomato, avocado. It's basically a soup bowl of salsa with a few shrimp and bits of crab meat and avocado thrown in. It's served cold, which I wasn't expecting. If you like fishing out your food from a bowl of salsa, this is the dish for you. I wasn't a fan.  Singapore sling ($11). A delicious cocktail made of gin, brandy, pineapple juice and some other stuff. It goes down a little too easy.  The bottle of coke that my wife ordered was cool. It's hard to screw up Coke.  I really want to like this place. I love the concept and I'm a big fan of Jos√© Andr√©s. I'll gladly go back to try other dishes because there are many items that sound delicious. I just hope my next meal won't be as torturous. haha... get it? Mao... torture...

      I enjoyed some of the food and drinks at China Poblano, but I am baffled as to what the fuss is all about.  My biggest pet peeve with this restaurant was that it is pretentiously creative.  I agree that the concept of Chinese and Mexican food served together is an interesting (and successful) one, but then it goes too far.  For example, I ordered gazpacho, expecting some semblance of a cold vegetable soup.  When the waitress brought a fruit plate with orange juice drizzled on top, I assumed the kitchen had made a simple mistake and tried to send it back.  She explained that it was, indeed, gazpacho.  But where was the soup?  She said that the orange juice was the liquid (but literally, the juice was squeezed on like you might squeeze lemon onto a piece of fish...there were only a few drops).  Call it a fruit plate, but don't call it gazpacho.  Gazpacho is a soup.  This was not soup.  The same thing happened with dessert.  I ordered the mango sticky rice and, behold, there was not a single grain of rice on the plate.  The waitress proudly proclaimed that it was "their take" on sticky rice, which was really a milky reduction with some mango puree.  If it had blown my mind flavor-wise, I would have been fine with it, but as it was it was a weak little dessert and the texture was slimy.  Also, unless you're dining with only one other person, the concept of sharing at this small plates restaurant will be frustrating.  I spent a relative lot of money on a not-too-substantial amount of food.  Plus, the carnitas tacos were too salty.  The service, too, was unimpressive.  Our waitress completely forgot to bring a drink my friend had ordered, and the servers were repeatedly bringing the wrong dishes to our table.  Everything seemed disorganized.  I loved my margarita, the salt breeze margarita (served with a delightfully light and airy salt foam on top).  I also loved the guacamole.  But, really, I can find good margaritas and guacamole at plenty of other places in Vegas.  On the whole, China Poblano was a disappointment.

      What do Mao Tse Tung and Frida Kahlo have in common?  Besides their intimate connections to communism and controversial personal lives, they also both appear as projected photographic wall art at China Poblano.  I adore Frida and collect mementos from her life.  I can't say the same for Mao but don't mind seeing his picture every so often at this restaurant.  China Poblano has a fresh concept, delicious food that mixes quality ingredients with creative combinations, and an artistic urban atmosphere.  If you come alone, sit at the bar, it's communal and gives you a peek into the kitchen with cooks demonstrating their skills.  If you come with a group, sit by the wall with exhibits of colorful Chinese masks and Mexican figurines, which appear surprisingly similar when displayed together, (these tables also have cushioned benches that are much more comfortable than the ones under photographs of Mao &amp; Frida).  Everything is tapas style, we discovered about 2 items per person is a good amount of food.  Scallop dumplings are very tasty and served in authentic bamboo steamers.  I also love the Dan Dan Mian, wheat noodles in a spicy ground pork sauce.  Hot &amp; sour soup has real content, not just broth.  But my favorite is the Singapore Sling, their signature cocktail.  It's very good gin paired with pineapple juice that they make in house plus other delicious things that come together for a fabulous concoction.  They did forget a couple of our orders so it seems like management is still settling in.  All forgivable under this prismatic fun house where I can eat delectable fusion food.

      Mediocre meal; did not have the "wow" factor I was hoping for.   To start, the hostess attempted to seat my client and I (both in business suits and obviously on a business lunch) at the "communal" table, where she said we would probably be joined by other diners but that "it's okay, because everyone is family."  We glanced around the restaurant and noticed lots of open two seater tables, and kindly requested a private table since we were on a business lunch.  The hostess seemed a bit flustered by our request, but did let us eat at our own table after offering us the bar instead, which we declined.    We tried the chips and salsa, queso fundido, langosta tacos (lobster), and mongolian beef lettuce.  The best part of the meal was the lobster tacos.  They were actually very tasty, although on the small side.  Everything else.... not what I expected from such a well known chef.  There's just not much to say besides it just being mediocre food.  Both of us decided it was not the memorable meal we were expecting.  With all of the dining choices at The Cosmopolitan, I will certainly try another option next time.

      Portion sizes are like tapas. Prices are like standard entrees. Tastes are nothing to remember. You're basically paying for flashy street food, but the prices are 3-4x more. I initially went to China Poblano because I heard that the tacos were insanely good. I must have misheard that conversation.  We started off with a pot of Golden Monkey tea, which was pretty good. They hand you a Perfect Tea Timer with your pot, so you can enjoy your brew just how you like it. I was impressed, so far. Then, I ordered some food.  Appetizesr: -Shu Mai Scallops (6 pcs) - Shu mai was more gooey than the usual plumpness that I expect from shu mai. It wasn't that great, especially for the $12 price. -Steamed oat noodles:  noodles were a little overcooked. Dipping sauce was average. Regretted ordering after first bite.  Food: -Pancita al Pastor (pork belly + pineapple tacos) (2 pcs) -  This was ok. Didn't blow my mind or anything. I'll take real $2 street tacos over these $9 tacos any day. -Viva China Tacos (beef tendon + oyster + scallions) -  a taco recommended by the waiter.  Again, nothing special. -Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich - A tasty, juicy pork sandwich. By far the best tasting food on our table. You only get one per order. And, it's tiny.  Overall, the apps were mediocre. The food is puny, bland, and pricey. Ended up spending over $30 a person and we were still hungry.  We stopped ordering food after receiving plate after plate of disappointment. We ended up going to the hidden pizza shop upstairs to make up for this mediocrity. Spent $4 there and enjoyed that meal that made my stomach and wallet happy.

      Let Down.   The concept is basically glorifying street food from China and Mexico, and by glorifying I mean marking the price up 200% and decreasing the size portions to basically nibbles.  The funny thing is, the whole concept behind street food is that it is really good and really cheap and you don't have to pay $4 for a taco the size of your pinky for it to be delicious. This place turns that truth on its head by doing exactly the opposite -- charging you a ton of money for mediocre "tastes" of food. I couldn't help but feel like the owners of this place are bleeding the patrons white, that is the bottom line people.    For the price of food and all the press I was expecting this place to be upscale.  It's not that either. Avoid at all costs.    **This review is based upon trying the following: --pomegranate margarita (didn't like at all, too tart) --When Pigs Fly --Dan dan noodles --Lengua tacos --Pork belly tacos with pineapple --Carnitas  Can you believe all of this was $100+? Avoid.   **Disclosure: I am a big Jose Andres fan, live in DC, and eat at all his restaurants.

      Oh where to start.... my visit with this restaurant was such a disappointment and embarrassment to me and the girls. We sent back almost every dish that was brought out to us. We started with chips and salsa a staple item to all mexican restaurants my friends ordered the guacamole and asked for it mild. The guacamole was excellent, spicy but oh so good. My friend sent it back it was too spicy. I had ordered Carnitas tacos which my server made a suggestion n the Cochinitas which are yucatan flavored pork with marinated onions he swore I would prefers these so I took his recommendation and ordered them they were brought out and Oh Hell no! they were awful I asked for the original order of carnitas and ugh! when they were brought out they were dripping with grease. I could not eat them. So I sat and ate chips and thought gosh I am getting pretty full..off these...chips...
